Rowling\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                            CHAPTER ONE\\n\\n   THE BOY WHO LIVED\\n\\n          M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\\nyou’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\\ndidn’t hold with such nonsense.\\n           Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\\nusual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\\ntime craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\n         The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\\nDursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\\npretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\\nhusband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\\nto think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\\nseen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\\ndidn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\n         When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\\nhummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\n         None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\n           At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\\n    “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\\nand backed out of number four’s drive.\\n            It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\n\\x0csomething peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t\\nrealize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There\\nwas a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in\\nsight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\\nlight. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\\ndrove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\\ncat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n        But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\\nDursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you\\nsaw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\\nDursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\\nstunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would\\nbe it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\n         Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\\nthat morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\\npeople down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\\nDursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\\nmore. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\n         He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\nthem next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know\\nwhy, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\\nhe couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\\nclutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\\nwere saying.\\n        “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”\\n\\x0c         “ — yes, their son, Harry —”\\n           Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\\n          He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\\ndialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\\ndown and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter\\nwasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\\nwho had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\\nwas called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\\nHarold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\\nany mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…\\nbut all the same, those people in cloaks.…\\n          He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\\nhe left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\\ninto someone just outside the door.\\n         “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\\na few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\ncloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\\ncontrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\\npassersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\\nRejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\\nshould be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\\n         And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\n         Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\\nwas rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\\nthings, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of\\nimagination.\\n          As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —\\nand it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It\\nwas now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\\nsame markings around its eyes.\\n         “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\\n          The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\\nbehavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\\ninto the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\n          Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\\n\\x0clearned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\\nhad been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\\non the evening news:\\n         “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\\nof these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The\\nnewscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\\nJim?”\\n         “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\\nYorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\\npromised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\\nhave been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But\\nI can promise a wet night tonight.”\\n         Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\\nwhisper, a whisper about the Potters.…\\n         Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\nno good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er\\n— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”\\n         As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\\nthey normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\\n        “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\\n          “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting\\nstars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”\\n        “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\n            “Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you\\nknow…her crowd.”\\n         Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\\nwhether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t\\ndare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about\\nDudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”\\n        “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n        “What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”\\n        “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”\\n          “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite\\n\\x0cagree.”\\n          He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\\nWhile Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\\nwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\\nstaring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\\n          Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\\nPotters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t\\nthink he could bear it.\\n           The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\\nbefore he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\\nreason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\\nwhat he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he\\nand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he\\nyawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…\\n        How very wrong he was.\\n         Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\\nthe wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\\nstatue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so\\nmuch as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\n          A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.\\nThe cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\n          Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\\nlong enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\\nswept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\\nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was\\nAlbus Dumbledore.\\n          Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\\nhe was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\\ncat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”\\n         He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\\n\\x0cnearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next\\nlamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\\nonly lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\\nwere the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\\nnow, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that\\nwas happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\\ninside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\\ndown on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he\\nspoke to it.\\n          “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\\n          He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\\na rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\\ncloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\\ndistinctly ruffled.\\n          “How did you know it was me?” she asked.\\n          “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\\n             “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n           “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.”\\n          Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n           “Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think\\nthey’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed\\nsomething’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the\\nDursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting\\nstars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\\nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\\nnever had much sense.”\\n           “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.”\\n          “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason\\nto lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\\nbroad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”\\n            She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\\nhoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine\\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\\nat last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\\nDumbledore?”\\n\\x0c        “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful\\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?”\\n        “A what?”\\n        “A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”\\n        “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t\\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\\nhas gone —”\\n        “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by\\nhis name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been\\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor\\nMcGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\\nseemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-\\nWho.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s\\nname.”\\n             “I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the\\nonly one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\\n        “You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will\\nnever have.”\\n        “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”\\n         “It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.”\\n         Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The\\nowls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\\nthey’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”\\n        It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\\npiercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying,\\nshe was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\\nDumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n           “What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort\\nturned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\\nand James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”\\n        Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n          “Lily and James…I can’t believe it…I didn’t want to believe it…Oh,\\nAlbus…”\\n           Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know…I\\nknow…” he said heavily.\\n\\x0c          Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all.\\nThey’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He\\ncouldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that\\nwhen he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and\\nthat’s why he’s gone.”\\n         Dumbledore nodded glumly.\\n         “It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done…\\nall the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of\\nall the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”\\n         “We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”\\n          Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\\nhands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\\npocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by\\nthe way?”\\n         “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to\\ntell me why you’re here, of all places?”\\n         “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family\\nhe has left now.”\\n            “You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\\n“Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find\\ntwo people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking\\nhis mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come\\nand live here!”\\n            “It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written\\nthem a letter.”\\n          “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\\nthe wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\\nThese people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I\\nwouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —\\nthere will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know\\nhis name!”\\n           “Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\\nhalf-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before\\nhe can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can you\\n\\x0csee how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready\\nto take it?”\\n         Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,\\nand then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting\\nhere, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might\\nbe hiding Harry underneath it.\\n        “Hagrid’s bringing him.”\\n         “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as\\nthis?”\\n        “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\\n             “I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend\\nto — what was that?”\\n            A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge\\nmotorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\n          If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.\\nHe was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He\\nlooked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black\\nhair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and\\nhis feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\\nhe was holding a bundle of blankets.\\n         “Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did\\nyou get that motorcycle?”\\n             “Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve\\ngot him, sir.”\\n        “No problems, were there?”\\n        “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before\\nthe Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over\\nBristol.”\\n         Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-\\nblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of\\nlightning.\\n        “Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n        “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”\\n        “Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”\\n\\x0c         “Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well —\\ngive him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\\n           Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’\\nhouse.\\n         “Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his\\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded\\ndog.\\n        “Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”\\n         “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\\nburying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor\\nlittle Harry off ter live with Muggles —”\\n         “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be\\nfound,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He\\nlaid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside\\nHarry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the\\nthree of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,\\nProfessor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\\nshone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n         “Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying\\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”\\n        “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike\\nback. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”\\n          Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the\\nair and off into the night.\\n              “I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said\\nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\n          Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of\\nlight sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\\nand he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\\nthe street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n           “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\\nswish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n        A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy\\nunder the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to\\n\\x0chappen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One\\nsmall hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was\\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few\\nhours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the\\nmilk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\\npinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment,\\npeople meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and\\nsaying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                           CHAPTER TWO\\n\\n   THE VANISHING GLASS\\n\\n    N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their\\nnephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun\\nrose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the\\nDursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly\\nthe same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news\\nreport about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed\\nhow much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of\\nwhat looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets —\\nbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a\\nlarge blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The\\nroom held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\n          Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.\\nHis Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise\\nof the day.\\n        “Up! Get up! Now!”\\n        Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n          “Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and\\nthen the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back\\nand tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.\\nThere had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the\\nsame dream before.\\n        His aunt was back outside the door.\\n        “Are you up yet?” she demanded.\\n        “Nearly,” said Harry.\\n         “Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”\\n        Harry groaned.\\n        “What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.\\n        “Nothing, nothing…”\\n         Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after\\n\\x0cpulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because\\nthe cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n         When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though\\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second\\ntelevision and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course\\nit involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but\\nhe couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.\\n         Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\\nDudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses\\nheld together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\\nwas a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever\\nremember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n         “In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask\\nquestions.”\\n           Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\\n        Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\n        “Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n         About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper\\nand shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than\\nthe rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair\\nsimply grew that way — all over the place.\\n         Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not\\nmuch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\\nhis thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\\n— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\n        Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\\nthere wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\\nface fell.\\n           “Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two\\nless than last year.”\\n\\x0c            “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here\\nunder this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”\\n          “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\\nwho could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\\nas fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\n           Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n“And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that,\\npopkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”\\n          Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”\\n         “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n         “Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right\\nthen.”\\n         Uncle Vernon chuckled.\\n            “Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy,\\nDudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\\n          At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He\\nwas ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from\\nthe telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n           “Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t\\ntake him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.\\n         Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was\\nleft behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\\nhated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him\\nlook at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.\\n           “Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\\nhe’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\\nher leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\\nbefore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n         “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n         “Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”\\n         The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there\\n— or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand\\nthem, like a slug.\\n         “What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”\\n\\x0c         “On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n          “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to\\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on\\nDudley’s computer).\\n         Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.\\n         “And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.\\n         “I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.\\n         “I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “…\\nand leave him in the car.…”\\n         “That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone.…”\\n           Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had\\nbeen years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face\\nand wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n         “Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special\\nday!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n            “I…don’t…want…him…t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge,\\npretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin\\nthrough the gap in his mother’s arms.\\n         Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt\\nPetunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss,\\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He\\nwas usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit\\nthem. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\n         Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the\\nback of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the\\nfirst time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else\\nto do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n           “I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up\\nclose to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at\\nall — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”\\n         “I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”\\n         But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\\n         The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.\\n         Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\\nas though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his\\nhair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that\\nhorrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless\\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his\\n\\x0cbaggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to\\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had\\nbeen given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain\\nthat he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\n         Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\\nold sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to\\npull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have\\nfitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided\\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.\\n         On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the\\nroof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when,\\nas much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the\\nchimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s\\nheadmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d\\ntried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry\\nsupposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\\n         But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his\\ncupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.\\n          While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and\\nHarry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\\n            “…roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a\\nmotorcycle overtook them.\\n          “I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly.\\n“It was flying.”\\n         Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around\\nin his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\\n“MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”\\n         Dudley and Piers sniggered.\\n         “I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”\\n            But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about\\nanything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a\\ncartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\\n         It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and\\nthen, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before\\n\\x0cthey could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t\\nbad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head\\nwho looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.\\n          Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to\\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were\\nstarting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their\\nfavorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley\\nhad a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on\\ntop, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the\\nfirst.\\n          Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\\nlast.\\n          After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there,\\nwith lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and\\nsnakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and\\nPiers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.\\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its\\nbody twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at\\nthe moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n            Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.\\n           “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\nglass, but the snake didn’t budge.\\n           “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n         “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\n           Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\nwouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company\\nexcept stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all\\nday long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only\\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got\\nto visit the rest of the house.\\n          The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.\\n         It winked.\\n            Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\n          The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n\\x0c        “I get that all the time.”\\n         “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the\\nsnake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”\\n        The snake nodded vigorously.\\n        “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.\\n         The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at\\nit.\\n        Boa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n        “Was it nice there?”\\n         The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to\\nBrazil?”\\n         As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both\\nof them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS\\nSNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”\\n        Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n          “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast\\nno one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right\\nup close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\\n        Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had\\nvanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the\\nfloor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the\\nexits.\\n        As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing\\nvoice said, “Brazil, here I come.… Thanksss, amigo.”\\n        The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n        “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”\\n         The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As\\nfar as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at\\ntheir heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car,\\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was\\nswearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,\\nwas Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you,\\nHarry?”\\n           Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say,\\n“Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and\\n\\x0cAunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\n\\n    Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t\\nknow what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\\nUntil they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\\n          He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died\\nin that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had\\ndied. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his\\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a\\nburning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he\\ncouldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his\\nparents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was\\nforbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\n          When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some\\nunknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that\\nstrangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were,\\ntoo. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping\\nwith Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man,\\nAunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-\\nlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street\\nthe other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all\\nthese people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\\ncloser look.\\n         At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody\\nliked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                          CHAPTER THREE\\n\\n   LETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\n    T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever\\npunishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera,\\ncrashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n           Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s\\ngang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of\\nthe lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in\\nDudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n          This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see\\na tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary\\nschool and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had\\nbeen accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was\\ngoing there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local\\npublic school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\\n         “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he\\ntold Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”\\n            “No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley\\ncould work out what he’d said.\\n            One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his\\nSmeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as\\nusual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she\\ndidn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and\\ngave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several\\nyears.\\n          That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly\\nsticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was\\n\\x0csupposed to be good training for later life.\\n           As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears\\nand said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so\\nhandsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of\\nhis ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\\n     ***\\n     There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went\\nin for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in\\ngray water.\\n          “What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\\n         “Your new school uniform,” she said.\\n         Harry looked in the bowl again.\\n         “Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”\\n          “Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s\\nold things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”\\n           Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his\\nfirst day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin,\\nprobably.\\n          Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of\\nthe smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on\\nthe table.\\n         They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\n         “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n         “Make Harry get it.”\\n         “Get the mail, Harry.”\\n         “Make Dudley get it.”\\n         “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”\\n          Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and —\\na letter for Harry.\\n          Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic\\nband. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no\\nfriends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even\\n\\x0cgot rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\\nplainly there could be no mistake:\\n    Mr. H. Potter\\n    The Cupboard under the Stairs\\n    4 Privet Drive\\n    Little Whinging\\n    Surrey\\n\\n    The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\n          Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a\\nlarge letter H.\\n         “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you\\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.\\n        Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle\\nVernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow\\nenvelope.\\n          Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\\nthe postcard.\\n        “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk.…”\\n        “Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”\\n         Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his\\nhand by Uncle Vernon.\\n        “That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n           “Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\\nopen with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the\\ngrayish white of old porridge.\\n        “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\\n          Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high\\nout of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a\\nmoment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a\\nchoking noise.\\n        “Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\\n            They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his\\nfather a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n\\x0c        “I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\\n        “I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”\\n          “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\ninside its envelope.\\n        Harry didn’t move.\\n        “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.\\n        “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\\n         “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door\\nbehind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who\\nwould listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from\\none ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\\n           “Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the\\naddress — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think\\nthey’re watching the house?”\\n         “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon\\nwildly.\\n          “But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we\\ndon’t want —”\\n          Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down\\nthe kitchen.\\n         “No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer…\\nYes, that’s best…we won’t do anything…”\\n        “But —”\\n          “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we\\ntook him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”\\n\\n    That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something\\nhe’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n        “Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\\nthrough the door. “Who’s writing to me?”\\n        “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.\\n“I have burned it.”\\n        “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”\\n         “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\\nlooked quite painful.\\n          “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\nthinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you\\n\\x0cmoved into Dudley’s second bedroom.\\n        “Why?” said Harry.\\n        “Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”\\n         The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where\\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit\\ninto his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he\\nowned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared\\naround him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera\\nwas lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\\ndoor neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which\\nhe’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there\\nwas a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at\\nschool for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because\\nDudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only\\nthings in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\\n           From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\\ndon’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”\\n          Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given\\nanything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter\\nthan up here without it.\\n\\n    Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.\\nHe’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on\\npurpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,\\nand he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time\\nyesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon\\nand Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\\n        When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his\\nSmelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one!\\n‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”\\n        With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground\\nto get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had\\ngrabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused\\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\\nstraightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\\n         “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry.\\n\\x0c“Dudley — go — just go.”\\n          Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had\\nmoved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first\\nletter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they\\ndidn’t fail. He had a plan.\\n\\n    The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned\\nit off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole\\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\n         He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\\nget the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the\\ndark hall toward the front door —\\n        “AAAAARRRGH!”\\n         Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on\\nthe doormat — something alive!\\n         Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,\\nsquashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the\\nfoot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do\\nexactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour\\nand then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into\\nthe kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\\nVernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\n          “I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes.\\n         Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed\\nup the mail slot.\\n        “See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they\\ncan’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”\\n        “I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\\n        “Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like\\nyou and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\n\\n    On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go\\nthrough the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the\\nsides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs\\nbathroom.\\n        Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back\\n\\x0cdoors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he\\nworked, and jumped at small noises.\\n\\n    On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry\\nfound their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through\\nthe living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the\\npost office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia\\nshredded the letters in her food processor.\\n          “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in\\namazement.\\n    ***\\n    On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\\ntired and rather ill, but happy.\\n            “No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\\nmarmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”\\n           Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and\\ncaught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters\\ncame pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry\\nleapt into the air trying to catch one —\\n         “Out! OUT!”\\n         Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming\\ninto the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n           “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five\\nminutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No\\narguments!”\\n         He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in\\nthe back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he\\ntried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\\n          They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where\\nthey were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while.\\n         “Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\\n         They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.\\n\\x0cHe’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five\\ntelevision programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without\\nblowing up an alien on his computer.\\n          Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and\\ndamp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the\\nwindowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…\\n\\n    They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the\\nnext day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their\\ntable.\\n        “’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred\\nof these at the front desk.”\\n        She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\n\\n   Mr. H. Potter\\n   Room 17\\n   Railview Hotel\\n   Cokeworth\\n\\n    Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of\\nthe way. The woman stared.\\n         “I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\\nher from the dining room.\\n    ***\\n    “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he\\nwas looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\\ngot out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\\nagain. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\\na suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\\n          “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\\nthat afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\\ncar, and disappeared.\\n        It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\\n         “It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I\\nwant to stay somewhere with a television.”\\n          Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and\\nyou could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\\n\\x0ctelevision — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course,\\nhis birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a\\ncoat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven\\nevery day.\\n         Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\\nthin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\\n        “Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”\\n           It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no\\ntelevision in there.\\n          “Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\\nhands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”\\n          A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\\n        “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\\n         It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks\\nand a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they\\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the\\nbroken-down house.\\n            The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and\\nempty. There were only two rooms.\\n           Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and\\nshriveled up.\\n        “Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.\\n           He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\\nchance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,\\nthough the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\\n          As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and\\nmade up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went\\noff to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\\nhe could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\n         The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\\ncouldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his\\nstomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls\\n\\x0cof thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which\\nwas dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven\\nin ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\\nthe Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\\n        Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\\nroof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got\\nback that he’d be able to steal one somehow.\\n         Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the\\nrock crumbling into the sea?\\n         One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty…ten…\\nnine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three…two…one…\\n       BOOM.\\n        The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.\\nSomeone was outside, knocking to come in.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                          CHAPTER FOUR\\n\\n   THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\n\\n     B OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\\n         “Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.\\n         There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands – now they knew what had been in the\\nlong, thin package he had brought with them.\\n         “Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”\\n         There was a pause. Then —\\n         SMASH!\\n          The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\n           A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but\\nyou could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\\n          The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back\\ninto its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look\\nat them all.\\n         “Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey.\\n…”\\n         He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\n         “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.\\n         Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n         “An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.\\n           Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n          “Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a\\nlot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”\\n         Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\n          “I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and\\nentering!”\\n          “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over\\n\\x0cthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a\\nknot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the\\nroom.\\n        Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n         “Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a\\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at\\nsome point, but it’ll taste all right.”\\n        From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed\\nbox. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate\\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\\n         Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”\\n        The giant chuckled.\\n         “True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\\nGrounds at Hogwarts.”\\n        He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.\\n         “What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d\\nnot say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”\\n         His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he\\nsnorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing\\nbut when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the\\nwhole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him\\nas though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\\n        The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a\\nbottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\\nSoon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a\\nthing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly\\nburnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\nsharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”\\n        The giant chuckled darkly.\\n          “Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’\\nworry.”\\n         He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t\\nreally know who you are.”\\n          The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\\n\\x0chand.\\n            “Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.\\n         “Er — no,” said Harry.\\n         Hagrid looked shocked.\\n         “Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\\n            “Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank\\nback into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’\\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer\\ncryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”\\n         “All what?” asked Harry.\\n         “ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”\\n         He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The\\nDursleys were cowering against the wall.\\n         “Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy —\\nthis boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”\\n          Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all,\\nand his marks weren’t bad.\\n         “I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\\n          But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean.\\nYour world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\\n         “What world?”\\n         Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n         “DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\n             Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that\\nsounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n          “But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re\\nfamous. You’re famous.”\\n         “What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\\n           “Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his\\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n         “Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\n         Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n         “Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy\\nanything!”\\n         A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with\\nrage.\\n         “You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\\n\\x0cleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it\\nfrom him all these years?”\\n         “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n         “STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n         Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n            “Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a\\nwizard.”\\n          There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind\\ncould be heard.\\n         “I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n         “A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which\\ngroaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve\\nbeen trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be?\\nAn’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\n            Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The\\nSea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\n   HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\n  Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n  (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme\\nMugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\n   Dear Mr. Potter,\\n   We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary\\nbooks and equipment.\\n   Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\\n   Yours sincerely,\\n\\n   Minerva McGonagall,\\n   Deputy Headmistress\\n\\n    Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t\\ndecide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it\\nmean, they await my owl?”\\n         “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another\\n\\x0cpocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking\\nowl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth\\nhe scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n\\n   Dear Professor Dumbledore,\\n   Given Harry his letter.\\n   Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\n   Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.\\n   Hagrid\\n\\n    Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak,\\nwent to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n        Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n           “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n        “He’s not going,” he said.\\n        Hagrid grunted.\\n        “I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n        “A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n          “A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them.\\nAn’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid\\neyes on.”\\n          “We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said\\nUncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”\\n        “You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”\\n          “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew!\\nHow could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter\\njust like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every\\nvacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the\\nonly one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and\\nfather, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in\\nthe family!”\\n          She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed\\nshe had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n         “Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had\\nyou, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as —\\nabnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we\\ngot landed with you!”\\n\\x0c           Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\\n“Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”\\n         “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys\\nscuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter?\\nIt’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every\\nkid in our world knows his name!”\\n        “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\n        The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n         “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea,\\nwhen Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much\\nyeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh —\\nbut someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\n        He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n         “Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell\\nyeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”\\n          He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It\\nbegins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t\\nknow his name, everyone in our world knows —”\\n        “Who?”\\n        “Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”\\n        “Why not?”\\n        “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult.\\nSee, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.\\nWorse than worse. His name was...”\\n        Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n        “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.\\n        “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort. ” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’\\nmake me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now,\\nstarted lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just\\nwanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark\\ndays, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange\\nwizards or witches…terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some\\nstood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left\\nwas Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid\\nof. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.\\n         “Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew.\\nHead boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-\\nKnow-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before…probably knew they were\\ntoo close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.\\n\\x0c          “Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em...maybe he just wanted ‘em\\noutta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all\\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer\\nhouse an’ — an’ —”\\n          Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew\\nhis nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n          “Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer\\npeople yeh couldn’t find — anyway….\\n          “You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of\\nthe thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,\\nor maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered\\nhow you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what\\nyeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad\\nan’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous,\\nHarry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’\\nhe’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons,\\nthe Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”\\n         Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story\\ncame to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than\\nhe had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the\\nfirst time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\n         Hagrid was watching him sadly.\\n             “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.\\nBrought yeh ter this lot….”\\n           “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost\\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have\\ngot back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\\n            “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something\\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and\\nas for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and\\nthe world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got,\\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always\\nknew they’d come to a sticky end —”\\n         But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\\numbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he\\nsaid, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word….”\\n         In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,\\nUncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and\\nfell silent.\\n\\x0c         “That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on\\nthe sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\n        Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n        “But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”\\n          “Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter\\nkill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see…he was\\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?\\n         “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\\nhuman left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I\\ndon’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em\\ncame outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’\\nback.\\n          “Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.\\nToo weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There\\nwas somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was,\\nno one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”\\n         Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but\\nHarry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a\\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life\\nbeing clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he\\nwas really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time\\nthey’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest\\nsorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him\\naround like a football?\\n        “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t\\nthink I can be a wizard.”\\n        To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n          “Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\nangry?”\\n          Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd\\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when\\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow\\nfound himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous\\nhaircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had\\nhit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?\\nHadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n        Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively\\nbeaming at him.\\n          “See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be\\n\\x0cright famous at Hogwarts.”\\n         But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n         “Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall\\nHigh and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of\\nrubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n          “If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled\\nHagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His\\nname’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of\\nwitchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know\\nhimself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under\\nthe greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”\\n             “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO\\nTEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.\\n         But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it\\nover his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS —\\nDUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”\\n            He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at\\nDudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp\\nsqueal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands\\nclasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them,\\nHarry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\n           Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\\nroom, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind\\nthem.\\n         Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\\n             “Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work\\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig\\nanyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”\\n         He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\n         “Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said.\\n“I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a\\nbit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so\\nkeen ter take on the job.”\\n         “Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.\\n         “Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell\\nyeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything.\\nBut Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”\\n         “Why were you expelled?”\\n         “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.\\n\\x0c“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”\\n         He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n          “You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think\\nI still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.”\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                            CHAPTER FIVE\\n\\n   DIAGON ALLEY\\n\\n    H arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight,\\nhe kept his eyes shut tight.\\n        “It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid\\ncame to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be\\nat home in my cupboard.”\\n        There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\n         And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\\nsinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\n        Tap. Tap. Tap.\\n        “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”\\n          He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa,\\nand there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its\\nbeak.\\n         Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake\\nup. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\\n        “Don’t do that.”\\n           Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n        “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n        “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n        “What?”\\n        “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\n         Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n        “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n        “Knuts?”\\n        “The little bronze ones.”\\n        Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so\\n\\x0cHarry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\\nthrough the open window.\\n         Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n         “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all\\nyer stuff fer school.”\\n         Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him\\nhad got a puncture.\\n         “Um — Hagrid?”\\n         “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n         “I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night…he\\nwon’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\\n          “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\\nhead. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”\\n         “But if their house was destroyed —”\\n          “They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\\nGringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’\\nsay no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\\n         “Wizards have banks?”\\n         “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\\n         Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n         “Goblins?”\\n         “Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess\\nwith goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh\\nwant ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit\\nGringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself\\nup proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you —\\ngettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.”\\n         “Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\\n          Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now\\nand the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still\\nthere, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n         “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\n         “Flew,” said Hagrid.\\n         “Flew?”\\n         “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve\\ngot yeh.”\\n           They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\\nimagine him flying.\\n\\x0c         “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\\nhis sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind\\nnot mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n         “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off\\ntoward land.\\n        “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n          “Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\nspoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh\\ngotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep\\nunder the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did\\nmanage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n          Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left\\nalone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many\\nquestions in his life.\\n        “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning\\nthe page.\\n           “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n           “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’\\ncourse, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.\\nBungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,\\naskin’ fer advice.”\\n        “But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n          “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still\\nwitches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\\n        “Why?”\\n          “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their\\nproblems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\\n          At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\n         Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to\\nthe station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and\\nsaying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n          “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n        “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”\\n\\x0c        “You’d like one?”\\n        “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\\n           They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\nminutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it,\\ngave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n         People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n        “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\\n        Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n        “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\\n           Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night\\nbefore, and read:\\n\\n   HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n   UNIFORM\\n   First-year students will require:\\n   1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\n   2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\n   3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\\n   4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\\nloudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n         “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n         Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\\nyou a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\\nCould there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\\nreally shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\\nhuge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the\\nDursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\\nthough everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t\\nhelp trusting him.\\n          “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a\\nfamous place.”\\n         It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry\\nwouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.\\nTheir eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\\nother as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\\nmost peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\\nmention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\n         For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\\nlong pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\\nquite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\\nat him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\\n         “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great\\n\\x0chand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\\n         “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be\\n—?”\\n         The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n           “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an\\nhonor.”\\n          He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\n         “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\\n           Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\\nwas beaming.\\n           Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n         “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\\n         “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n         “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\\n           “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\\nDiggle.”\\n         “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in\\nhis excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\\n            “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\\n“Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again —\\nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n           A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\\neyes was twitching.\\n          “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\\nof your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n           “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-\\ncan’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\\n         “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n         “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as\\nthough he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\\nHe laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve\\ng-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\\nthe very thought.\\n          But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\\nmake himself heard over the babble.\\n\\x0c         “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\n          Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\\nbut a trash can and a few weeds.\\n         Hagrid grinned at Harry.\\n          “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\\nwas tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n         “Is he always that nervous?”\\n         “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’\\noutta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\\nsay he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with\\na hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\n          Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n         “Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\\n         He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\n           The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\\nsmall hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were\\nfacing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\\nstreet that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n         “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\n           He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\\nHarry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\\nback into solid wall.\\n          The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\\nCauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n         “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\\nfirst.”\\n         Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\\noutside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon\\nliver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\\n          A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\\nOwl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\\nabout Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\\nit. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —\\n\\x0cfastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\\nstrange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\\nbarrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\\nrolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\\n         “Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\n           They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\\nscarlet and gold, was —\\n          “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\\na swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\\nfeet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\n     Enter, stranger, but take heed\\n     Of what awaits the sin of greed,\\n     For those who take, but do not earn,\\n     Must pay most dearly in their turn.\\n     So if you seek beneath our floors\\n     A treasure that was never yours,\\n     Thief, you have been warned, beware\\n     Of finding more than treasure there.\\n\\n    “Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\\n        A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\\nbehind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\\nexamining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\\ncount leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\\nof these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\\n          “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some\\nmoney outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\\n        “You have his key, sir?”\\n           “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\\ngoblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\\ngoblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\\n        “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n        The goblin looked at it closely.\\n        “That seems to be in order.”\\n\\x0c         “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\\nseven hundred and thirteen.”\\n        The goblin read the letter carefully.\\n           “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone\\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\\n         Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\\nthe doors leading off the hall.\\n            “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\\nHarry asked.\\n          “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts\\nbusiness. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\n           Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\\nfloor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\\nthem. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\\n         At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\\nto remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\\nThe rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t\\nsteering.\\n           Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\\ntwisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even\\ndeeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\\nfrom the ceiling and floor.\\n         “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s\\nthe difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n          “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions\\njust now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\\n         He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\\nhis knees from trembling.\\n          Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\\nand as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\\nsilver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n        “All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\n            All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known\\n\\x0cabout this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\\nbeen a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\n         Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n         “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\\nGriphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\\nslowly?”\\n         “One speed only,” said Griphook.\\n          They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\\nunderground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\\nat the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\\nneck.\\n         Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n           “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\\nwith one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n         “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the\\ndoor and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\\n         “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\\n         “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\n          Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\\nat the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\\nlittle package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\\nbetter than to ask.\\n           “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way\\nback, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n    One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\\nHarry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\\nwas holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than\\neven Dudley had ever had.\\n          “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\\nMalkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\\noff fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did\\n\\x0cstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling\\nnervous.\\n         Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n           “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot\\nhere — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\n         In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\\nfootstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\\nstood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\\nto pin it to the right length.\\n         “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n         “Yes,” said Harry.\\n            “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street\\nlooking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m\\ngoing to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t\\nhave their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in\\nsomehow.”\\n         Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n         “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n         “No,” said Harry.\\n         “Play Quidditch at all?”\\n         “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n          “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house,\\nand I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n         “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n          “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll\\nbe in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\\nI’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n             “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\\ninteresting.\\n         “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\\nwindow. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\\nice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n          “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.\\n“He works at Hogwarts.”\\n         “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n          “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\\nevery second.\\n         “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school\\ngrounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up\\n\\x0csetting fire to his bed.”\\n         “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n         “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where\\nare your parents?”\\n          “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into\\nthe matter with this boy.\\n         “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our\\nkind, weren’t they?”\\n         “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n         “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just\\nnot the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\\nhave never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\\nshould keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n          But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done,\\nmy dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\\ndown from the footstool.\\n         “Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n           Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n         “What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n          “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\\nWhen they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”\\n           “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’\\nabout Quidditch!”\\n          “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\\nboy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n         “— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed\\nin —”\\n           “Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s\\ngrown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what\\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what\\ndoes he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with\\nmagic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had\\nfer a sister!”\\n         “So what is Quidditch?”\\n         “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world\\n— everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and\\nthere’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\x0c         “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n            “School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\nduffers, but —”\\n         “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n           “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who\\nwas one.”\\n         “Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\\n         “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\n          They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\\nstones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\\nfull of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\\nDudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on\\nsome of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and\\nCountercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the\\nLatest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More)\\nby Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n         “I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n          “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway,\\nyeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh\\nget ter that level.”\\n           Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says\\npewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion\\ningredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,\\nwhich was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad\\neggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs,\\ndried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of\\nfangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\\nbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry\\nhimself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and\\nminuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n         Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\\n           “Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday\\npresent.”\\n         Harry felt himself go red.\\n         “You don’t have to —”\\n          “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad,\\n\\x0ctoads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats,\\nthey make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead\\nuseful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\n         Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her\\nwing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\nQuirrell.\\n         “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n        A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n         The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a\\nfaded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n        A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library;\\nhe swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For\\nsome reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n          “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\\nspindly chair.\\n          An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\\n        “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n          “Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon.\\nHarry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only\\nyesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter\\ninches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\n          Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.\\nThose silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n           “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\\ninches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say\\nyour father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\n         Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\x0c        “And that’s where…”\\n           Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a\\nlong, white finger.\\n          “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-\\nand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong\\nhands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\\n…”\\n        He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n           “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, sixteen\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\\n        “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\\n          “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you\\ngot expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n          “Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got\\nthe pieces, though,” he added brightly.\\n        “But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n           “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n           “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well,\\nnow — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver\\nmarkings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\\n        “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\\n           “Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.\\nAs he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful\\nmagical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and\\nthe heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no\\ntwo unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”\\n           Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting\\naround the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n         “That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the\\nfloor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring.\\nNine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”\\n         Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n        “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\\n           Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\n\\x0csnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n        “No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\\nGo on, go on, try it out.”\\n         Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he\\nseemed to become.\\n          “Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here\\nsomewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly\\nand phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\\n         Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a\\nstream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing\\ndancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr.\\nOllivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how\\ncurious…how very curious…”\\n          He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\\nstill muttering, “Curious…curious…\\n        “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\n        Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n        “I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It\\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for\\nthis wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\n        Harry swallowed.\\n         “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must expect great\\nthings from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great\\nthings — terrible, yes, but great.”\\n          Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He\\npaid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\\nshop.\\n\\n    The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their\\nway back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he\\ndidn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground,\\nladen as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl\\nasleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington\\n\\x0cstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the\\nshoulder.\\n        “Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\\n         He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\\nthem. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n        “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\n        Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his\\nlife — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\n          “Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander…but I don’t know anything\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t\\neven remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,\\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”\\n         Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\\nwore a very kind smile.\\n         “Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the\\nbeginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard.\\nYeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at\\nHogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”\\n           Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n         “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross\\n— it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with\\nyer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Harry.”\\n        The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he\\nwas out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but\\nhe blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                            CHAPTER SIX\\n\\n   THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\n\\n     H arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so\\nscared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and\\nUncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or\\nshout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half\\nfurious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although\\nthis was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a\\nwhile.\\n        Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to\\ncall her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books\\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig\\nswooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt\\nPetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back\\ndead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on\\nthe piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the\\nfirst.\\n          On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and\\nuncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the\\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his\\nthroat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the\\nroom.\\n        “Er — Uncle Vernon?”\\n        Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n        “Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”\\n        Uncle Vernon grunted again.\\n        “Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\\n        Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n        “Thank you.”\\n        He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\n         “Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got\\npunctures, have they?”\\n        Harry didn’t say anything.\\n        “Where is this school, anyway?”\\n\\x0c        “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the\\nticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n           “I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven\\no’clock,” he read.\\n        His aunt and uncle stared.\\n        “Platform what?”\\n        “Nine and three-quarters.”\\n        “Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and\\nthree-quarters.”\\n        “It’s on my ticket.”\\n        “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see.\\nYou just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to\\nLondon tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”\\n          “Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things\\nfriendly.\\n          “Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have\\nthat ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”\\n\\n     Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and\\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t\\nwant to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train.\\nHe checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he\\nneeded, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room,\\nwaiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk\\nhad been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into\\nsitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\n           They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped\\nHarry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms\\nwith a nasty grin on his face.\\n         “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform\\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do\\nthey?”\\n         He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the\\nmiddle, nothing at all.\\n         “Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All\\nthree of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was\\n\\x0che going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of\\nHedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\\n         He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and\\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t\\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as\\nthough Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the\\nend the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\\nminutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket\\nfull of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n          Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\\nshould get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between\\nplatforms nine and ten.\\n        At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\\nfew words of what they were saying.\\n        “— packed with Muggles, of course —”\\n        Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to\\nfour boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\\nHarry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.\\n         Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n        “Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.\\n         “Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\\nholding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”\\n          “You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\\nfirst.”\\n         What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\\nHarry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy\\nreached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists\\ncame swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared\\naway, the boy had vanished.\\n        “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\\n          “I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call\\nyourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”\\n        “Sorry, George, dear.”\\n         “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called\\n\\x0cafter him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had\\ngone — but how had he done it?\\n          Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\\nalmost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\\n        There was nothing else for it.\\n        “Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\\n        “Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”\\n         She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n        “Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —”\\n        “How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\\n          “Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the\\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll\\ncrash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.\\nGo on, go now before Ron.”\\n        “Er — okay,” said Harry.\\n          He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\\nsolid.\\n        He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms\\nnine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that\\nbarrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a\\nheavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to\\nstop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes\\nready for the crash —\\n        It didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\\nengine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said\\nHogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a\\nwrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine\\nand Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\\n         Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted\\nto one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of\\nheavy trunks.\\n        The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\\nout of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\\npushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\\nround-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\\n        “Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\\n        A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\n\\x0c         “Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\\n          The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\n               Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\\ncompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\\nstarted to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\\nthe steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\\nfoot.\\n         “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through\\nthe barrier.\\n         “Yes, please,” Harry panted.\\n         “Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\\n         With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\\nthe compartment.\\n         “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\n            “What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s\\nlightning scar.\\n         “Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you —?”\\n         “He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.\\n         “What?” said Harry.\\n         “Harry Potter.” chorused the twins.\\n         “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\\n         The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\\nhis relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.\\n         “Fred? George? Are you there?”\\n         “Coming, Mom.”\\n         With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\n          Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch\\nthe red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their\\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n         “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\\n          The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose.\\n         “Mom — geroff” He wriggled free.\\n           “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the\\ntwins.\\n         “Shut up,” said Ron.\\n         “Where’s Percy?” said their mother.\\n         “He’s coming now.”\\n\\x0c         The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his\\nchest with the letter P on it.\\n         “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got\\ntwo compartments to themselves —”\\n        “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great\\nsurprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”\\n         “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the\\nother twin. “Once —”\\n        “Or twice —”\\n        “A minute —”\\n        “All summer —”\\n        “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\\n        “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.\\n         “Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well,\\nhave a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”\\n        She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\n          “Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\\nowl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”\\n        “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”\\n        “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”\\n        “It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”\\n        “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”\\n        “Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and\\nhis nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n        “Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”\\n        Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.\\n         “You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know\\nwho he is?”\\n        “Who?”\\n        “Harry Potter!”\\n        Harry heard the little girl’s voice.\\n        “Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....”\\n         “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you\\ngoggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”\\n        “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”\\n          “Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so\\npolite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”\\n           “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who\\n\\x0clooks like?”\\n         Their mother suddenly became very stern.\\n          “I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs\\nreminding of that on his first day at school.”\\n         “All right, keep your hair on.”\\n         A whistle sounded.\\n           “Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\\nyounger sister began to cry.\\n         “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\\n         “We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.”\\n         “George!”\\n         “Only joking, Mom.”\\n          The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their\\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it\\ngathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\n         Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\\ncorner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\\ndidn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was\\nleaving behind.\\n          The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\\ncame in.\\n           “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\\n“Everywhere else is full.”\\n           Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and\\nthen looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw\\nhe still had a black mark on his nose.\\n         “Hey, Ron.”\\n         The twins were back.\\n          “Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a\\ngiant tarantula down there.”\\n         “Right,” mumbled Ron.\\n            “Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”\\n           “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\\nbehind them.\\n         “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\n         Harry nodded.\\n         “Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said\\n\\x0cRon. “And have you really got — you know…”\\n        He pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\n        Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n        “So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”\\n        “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n        “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n        “Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\\n         “Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\\nwindow again.\\n           “Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\ninteresting as Ron found him.\\n          “Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin\\nwho’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\\n        “So you must know loads of magic already.”\\n          The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n        “I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\\n          “Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\nthough. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”\\n           “Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the\\nsixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to.\\nBill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain\\nof Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but\\nthey still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.\\nEveryone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,\\nbecause they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.\\nI’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”\\n          Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\\nasleep.\\n          “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I\\nmean, I got Scabbers instead.”\\n        Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he\\nwent back to staring out of the window.\\n           Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\\nafford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago,\\nand he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never\\ngetting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\\n\\x0c            “…and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”\\n         Ron gasped.\\n         “What?” said Harry.\\n          “You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked\\nand impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”\\n         “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I\\njust never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn.…I bet,”\\nhe added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot\\nlately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”\\n         “You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families\\nand they learn quick enough.”\\n          While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for\\na time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\n            Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything\\noff the cart, dears?”\\n           Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out\\ninto the corridor.\\n          He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that\\nhe had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\\nBars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did\\nhave were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum,\\nChocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a\\nnumber of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to\\nmiss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver\\nSickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\n         Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\\nit onto an empty seat.\\n         “Hungry, are you?”\\n         “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\n          Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\\nsandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I\\ndon’t like corned beef..”\\n         “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on —”\\n         “You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,”\\nhe added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”\\n\\x0c         “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share\\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with\\nRon, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the\\nsandwiches lay forgotten).\\n          “What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate\\nFrogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing\\nwould surprise him.\\n        “No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”\\n        “What?”\\n          “Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards,\\ninside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about\\nfive hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”\\n        Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\\nman’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing\\nsilver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus\\nDumbledore.\\n        “So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n        “Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have\\na frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n        Harry turned over his card and read:\\n\\n   ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n   CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\n    C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for\\nthe discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy\\nwith his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music\\nand tenpin bowling.\\n\\n   Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\\nDumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n       “He’s gone!”\\n       “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be\\nback. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it?\\nYou can start collecting.”\\n           Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\\nunwrapped.\\n          “Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,\\n\\x0cpeople just stay put in photos.”\\n            “Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed.\\n“Weird!”\\n          Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\\ngave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off\\nthem. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\\nWoodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\\neyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a\\nbag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.\\n         “You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say\\nevery flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones\\nlike chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\\nliver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”\\n         Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\\n         “Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”\\n          They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even\\nbrave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which\\nturned out to be pepper.\\n          The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The\\nneat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\\nhills.\\n         There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\\ntearful.\\n         “Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\\n         When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting\\naway from me!”\\n         “He’ll turn up,” said Harry.\\n         “Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”\\n         He left.\\n         “Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d\\nlose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”\\n         The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.\\n         “He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in\\ndisgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\\nthe spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look…”\\n         He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\\n\\x0cwand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\\n        “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”\\n         He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\\nThe toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n         “Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\\n          “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\\nwasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n        “Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\\n        She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n        “Er — all right.”\\n        He cleared his throat.\\n\\n   “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\\n   Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”\\n\\n          He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\\nasleep.\\n         “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good,\\nis it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.\\nNobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\\nletter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of\\nwitchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of\\ncourse, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who\\nare you?”\\n         She said all this very fast.\\n         Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\\nhadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n         “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n         “Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n          “Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I\\ngot a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical\\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\\nthe Twentieth Century.”\\n         “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n          “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it\\nwas me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve\\nbeen asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\\n\\x0chear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too\\nbad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better\\nchange, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\n        And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n         “Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his\\nwand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it\\nwas a dud.”\\n        “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n           “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\\n“Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t\\nsuppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”\\n        “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”\\n        “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n         “You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said\\nHarry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do\\nnow that they’ve left, anyway?”\\n        Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.\\n           “Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing\\nsomething for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all\\nover the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles —\\nsomeone tried to rob a high security vault.”\\n        Harry stared.\\n        “Really? What happened to them?”\\n         “Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My\\ndad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\\ndon’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared\\nwhen something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\\n         Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\\nof fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\\npart of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\\n“Voldemort” without worrying.\\n        “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n        “Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\\n         “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in\\nthe world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\\npositions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his\\nbrothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just\\ntaking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\\nslid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\\n\\x0cthis time.\\n         Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\\nlot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n            “Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry\\nPotter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\\n          “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\\nthickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\\nlooked like bodyguards.\\n            “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly,\\nnoticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\n         Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\\nMalfoy looked at him.\\n           “Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\\nfather told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\\nthey can afford.”\\n          He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families\\nare much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the\\nwrong sort. I can help you there.”\\n         He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\\n           “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\\ncoolly.\\n         Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\\n         “I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit\\npoliter you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good\\nfor them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\\nand it’ll rub off on you.”\\n         Both Harry and Ron stood up.\\n         “Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n         “Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.\\n         “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\n          “But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food\\nand you still seem to have some.”\\n           Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt\\nforward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\n          Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\\ninto Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\\nScabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit\\n\\x0cthe window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\\nwere more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps,\\nbecause a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n          “What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\n         “I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\\nScabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.”\\n        And so he had.\\n        “You’ve met Malfoy before?”\\n        Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\n         “I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first\\nto come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been\\nbewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an\\nexcuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you\\nwith something?”\\n          “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the\\nfront to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been\\nfighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”\\n         “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would\\nyou mind leaving while we change?”\\n          “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving\\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy\\nvoice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\\n          Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\\ngetting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\\ntrain did seem to be slowing down.\\n          He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\\nRon’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\\n         A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\\nminutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the\\nschool separately.”\\n        Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\\nhis freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\\nthe crowd thronging the corridor.\\n           The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\\nway toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\\ncold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\\nHarry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,\\nHarry?”\\n\\x0c        Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\n          “C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’\\nyears follow me!”\\n         Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there\\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing\\nhis toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n          “Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his\\nshoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”\\n        There was a loud “Oooooh!”\\n           The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black\\nlake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\\nthe starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\n          “No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their\\nboat by Neville and Hermione.\\n         “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then\\n— FORWARD!”\\n         And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake,\\nwhich was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle\\noverhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on\\nwhich it stood.\\n         “Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all\\nbent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid\\na wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which\\nseemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind\\nof underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\n          “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the\\nboats as people climbed out of them.\\n            “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last\\nonto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\n        They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak\\nfront door.\\n        “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”\\n        Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                         CHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\n   THE SORTING HAT\\n\\n    T he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that\\nthis was not someone to cross.\\n        “The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n        “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\n        She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit\\nthe whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a\\nmagnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\n           They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.\\nHarry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right —\\nthe rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed\\nthe first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,\\nstanding rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about\\nnervously.\\n         “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term\\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you\\nwill be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony\\nbecause, while you are here, your house will be something like your family\\nwithin Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your\\nhouse dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\\n           “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\\noutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will\\nearn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end\\nof the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great\\nhonor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n         “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can\\nwhile you are waiting.”\\n         Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened\\nunder his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten\\n\\x0chis hair.\\n          “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“Please wait quietly.”\\n         She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n         “How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\\n           “Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\njoking.”\\n          Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school?\\nBut he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He\\nhadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around\\nanxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the\\nspells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not\\nto listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to\\ntake a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his\\nteacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now,\\nProfessor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\\n         Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air —\\nseveral people behind him screamed.\\n         “What the —?”\\n          He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\\nglided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first\\nyears. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying:\\n“Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”\\n         “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what\\nare you all doing here?”\\n         A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\n         Nobody answered.\\n         “New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be\\nSorted, I suppose?”\\n         A few people nodded mutely.\\n           “Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you\\nknow.”\\n          “Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about\\nto start.”\\n         Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\\nthrough the opposite wall.\\n\\x0c           “Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and\\nfollow me.”\\n         Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the\\nchamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great\\nHall.\\n         Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four\\nlong tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid\\nwith glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years\\nup here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\\nteachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale\\nlanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students,\\nthe ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked\\nupward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione\\nwhisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts,\\nA History.”\\n         It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great\\nHall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.\\n            Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\\nplaced a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a\\npointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt\\nPetunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.\\n          Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\\nthat seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now\\nstaring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete\\nsilence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth —\\nand the hat began to sing:\\n\\n   “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\\n   But don’t judge on what you see,\\n   I’ll eat myself if you can find\\n   A smarter hat than me.\\n   You can keep your bowlers black,\\n   Your top hats sleek and tall,\\n   For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\n   And I can cap them all.\\n   There’s nothing hidden in your head\\n\\x0c   The Sorting Hat can’t see,\\n   So try me on and I will tell you\\n   Where you ought to be.\\n   You might belong in Gryffindor,\\n   Where dwell the brave at heart,\\n   Their daring, nerve, and chivalry\\n   Set Gryffindors apart;\\n   You might belong in Hufflepuff,\\n   Where they are just and loyal,\\n   Those patient Hufflepuffs are true\\n   And unafraid of toil;\\n   Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\n   if you’ve a ready mind,\\n   Where those of wit and learning,\\n   Will always find their kind;\\n   Or perhaps in Slytherin\\n   You’ll make your real friends,\\n   Those cunning folk use any means\\n   To achieve their ends.\\n   So put me on! Don’t be afraid!\\n   And don’t get in a flap!\\n   You’re in safe hands (though I have none)\\n   For I’m a Thinking Cap!”\\n\\n    The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to\\neach of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n         “So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill\\nFred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\\n        Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having\\nto do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone\\nwatching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or\\nquick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house\\nfor people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\n           Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\nparchment.\\n        “When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be\\nsorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”\\n          A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause —\\n\\x0c         “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\n         The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\\n         “Bones, Susan!”\\n           “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit\\nnext to Hannah.\\n         “Boot, Terry!”\\n         “RAVENCLAW!”\\n           The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n          “Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender”\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with\\ncheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n          “Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s\\nimagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like\\nan unpleasant lot.\\n         He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked\\nfor teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,\\nnot because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they\\nliked him.\\n         “Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n         “HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n          Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\\nothers it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy\\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the\\nhat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n         “Granger, Hermione!”\\n         Her     mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her\\nhead.\\n         “GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n           A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\\nyou’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there\\nwith the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his\\nhead and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the\\ntrain?\\n         When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\\nhe fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with\\nNeville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing\\nit, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\n\\x0c         Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\\nonce: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\n          Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with\\nhimself.\\n                There weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…,\\n“Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks,\\nSally-Anne”…, and then, at last —\\n         “Potter, Harry!”\\n         As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing\\nfires all over the hall.\\n         “Potter, did she say?”\\n         “The Harry Potter?”\\n           The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking\\nat the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n          “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of\\ncourage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and\\na nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put\\nyou?”\\n            Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\\nSlytherin.\\n          “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be\\ngreat, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the\\nway to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be\\nGRYFFINDOR!”\\n         Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the\\nhat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have\\nbeen chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the\\nloudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while\\nthe Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down\\nopposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving\\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold\\nwater.\\n           He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\\nHagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.\\nAnd there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus\\nDumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the\\nChocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the\\nwhole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,\\n\\x0ctoo, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very\\npeculiar in a large purple turban.\\n         And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,”\\na Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,\\nLisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by\\nnow. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had\\nshouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\n         Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to\\nhim.\\n        “Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry\\nas “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n          Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized\\nhow hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\n            Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the\\nstudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than\\nto see them all there.\\n          “Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we\\nbegin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n        “Thank you!”\\n         He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know\\nwhether to laugh or not.\\n        “Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n         “Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But\\nhe is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”\\n         Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\\nfood. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef,\\nroast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled\\npotatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup,\\nand, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\n            The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been\\nallowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry\\nreally wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of\\neverything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n         “That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\\ncut up his steak.\\n        “Can’t you —?”\\n         “I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t\\n\\x0cneed to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir\\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor\\nTower.”\\n          “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about\\nyou — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”\\n           “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost\\nbegan stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n         “Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”\\n          Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going\\nat all the way he wanted.\\n         “Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole\\nhead swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.\\nSomeone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking\\npleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his\\nhead back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope\\nyou’re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have\\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a\\nrow! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin\\nghost.”\\n          Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting\\nthere, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.\\nHe was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too\\npleased with the seating arrangements.\\n         “How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.\\n         “I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\n         When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\\nfaded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later\\nthe desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,\\napple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries,\\nJell-O, rice pudding…\\n         As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n          “I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell\\nhim she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\n         The others laughed.\\n         “What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n          “Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the\\nfamily thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to\\ncatch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the\\nend of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I\\n\\x0cwas eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out\\nof an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a\\nmeringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the\\ngarden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was\\nso happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they\\nthought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was\\nso pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n         On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\\nlessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m\\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into\\nsomething else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be\\nstarting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n         Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High\\nTable again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall\\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban,\\nwas talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n             It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past\\nQuirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across\\nthe scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n        “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n        “What is it?” asked Percy.\\n        “N-nothing.”\\n         The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the\\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like\\nHarry at all.\\n        “Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n          “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so\\nnervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —\\neveryone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark\\nArts, Snape.”\\n        Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.\\n          At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to\\nhis feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n         “Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I\\nhave a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n         “First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all\\npupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n          Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\\ntwins.\\n\\x0c        “I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that\\nno magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n          “Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone\\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n         “And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the\\nright-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very\\npainful death.”\\n        Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n        “He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n          “Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he\\nusually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s\\nfull of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us\\nprefects, at least.”\\n           “And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried\\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather\\nfixed.\\n         Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly\\noff the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the\\ntables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n        “Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”\\n        And the school bellowed:\\n    “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\n    Teach us something please,\\n    Whether we be old and bald\\n    Or young with scabby knees,\\n    Our heads could do with filling\\n    With some interesting stuff,\\n    For now they’re bare and full of air,\\n    Dead flies and bits of fluff,\\n    So teach us things worth knowing,\\n    Bring back what we’ve forgot,\\n    just do your best, we’ll do the rest,\\n    And learn until our brains all rot.”\\n\\n   Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley\\ntwins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore\\nconducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was\\none of those who clapped loudest.\\n        “Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here!\\n\\x0cAnd now, bedtime. Off you trot!”\\n         The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,\\nout of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead\\nagain, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even\\nto be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and\\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden\\nbehind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,\\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much\\nfarther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n          A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as\\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\n          “Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised\\nhis voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”\\n         A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n         “Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\n           There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide\\nmouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n         “Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”\\n         He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n           “Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked\\nPercy.\\n         Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on\\nNeville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he\\npassed.\\n          “You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again.\\n“The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to\\nus prefects. Here we are.”\\n          At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\\npink silk dress.\\n         “Password?” she said.\\n         “Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a\\nround hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up\\n— and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room\\nfull of squashy armchairs.\\n         Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys\\nthrough another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of\\nthe towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red,\\nvelvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk\\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n\\x0c        “Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get\\noff, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”\\n        Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell\\nasleep almost at once.\\n         Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange\\ndream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him,\\ntelling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.\\nHarry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and\\nheavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy,\\nlaughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-\\nnosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of\\ngreen light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\n          He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\\ndidn’t remember the dream at all.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                          CHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\n   THE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\n    T here, look.”\\n        “Where?”\\n        “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”\\n        “Wearing the glasses?”\\n        “Did you see his face?”\\n        “Did you see his scar?”\\n        Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\\nday. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or\\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they\\nwouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n           There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a\\nFriday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to\\njump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or\\ntickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all,\\nbut solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where\\nanything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the\\nportraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor\\ncould walk.\\n         The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless\\nNick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but\\nPeeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you\\nmet him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on\\nyour head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak\\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\\n         Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first\\nmorning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that\\nunluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third\\nfloor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into\\nit on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were\\n\\x0crescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\n          Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature\\nwith bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone.\\nBreak a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for\\nFilch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret\\npassageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley\\ntwins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated\\nhim, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n          And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than\\nwaving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\n             They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements\\nof the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the\\ncastle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and\\nfound out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of\\nMagic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very\\nold indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up\\nnext morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on\\nwhile they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric\\nthe Oddball mixed up.\\n         Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he\\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak\\nand toppled out of sight.\\n         Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\\nthink she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to\\nthe moment they sat down in her first class.\\n         “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\\nwill learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will\\nleave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\n         Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very\\nimpressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going\\nto be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of\\ncomplicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into\\na needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any\\ndifference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone\\nall silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\x0c           The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His\\nclassroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a\\nvampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him\\none of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African\\nprince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t\\nsure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked\\neagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and\\nstarted talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell\\nhung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of\\ngarlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\n         Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone\\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had\\nany idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that\\neven people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n        Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n         “What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\\nporridge.\\n            “Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s\\ntrue.”\\n         “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was\\nhead of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile\\nof homework the day before.\\n         Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it\\nhad given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls\\nhad suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables\\nuntil they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n         Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with\\nthe other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the\\nmarmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore\\nit open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n\\n   Dear Harry,\\n   I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a\\ncup of tea with me around three?\\n   I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\n\\x0cHedwig.\\n   Hagrid\\n\\n     Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back\\nof the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n         It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\\nfar.\\n          At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been\\nwrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\n          Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough\\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n           Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\\nFlitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n        “Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\n         Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes\\nwere black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold\\nand empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n        “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,”\\nhe began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\\n— like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent\\nwithout effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will\\nhardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty\\nof the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power\\nof liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\\nsenses.…I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death —\\nif you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\\n        More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\\nwith raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked\\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.\\n          “Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered\\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”\\n          Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,\\nwho looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air.\\n        “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.\\n        Snape’s lips curled into a sneer.\\n\\x0c         “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n         He ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n          “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\nbezoar?”\\n          Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.\\nHe tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with\\nlaughter.\\n         “I don’t know, sir.”\\n          “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry\\nforced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked\\nthrough his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember\\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n         Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n         “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n           At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\nceiling.\\n         “I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why\\ndon’t you try her?”\\n         A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.\\nSnape, however, was not pleased.\\n            “Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter,\\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat\\nand it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they\\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t\\nyou all copying that down?”\\n         There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,\\nSnape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,\\nPotter.”\\n             Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple\\npotion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them\\nweigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except\\nMalfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the\\nperfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green\\nsmoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to\\nmelt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across\\nthe stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class\\n\\x0cwas standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all\\nover his arms and legs.\\n           “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\\nwave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the\\ncauldron off the fire?”\\n        Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n           “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n         “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\\nhe’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point\\nyou’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\\n         This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\\nhim behind their cauldron.\\n        “Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”\\n         As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind\\nwas racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his\\nvery first week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n            “Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and\\nGeorge. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”\\n            At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden\\nforest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\n           When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\\nseveral booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang —\\nback.”\\n        Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\\n        “Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\\n          He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\\nblack boarhound.\\n        There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from\\nthe ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n         “Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\\nfierce as he looked.\\n          “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n          “Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spent\\n\\x0chalf me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\\n        The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all\\nover his robes.\\n        Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n           “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang\\nsometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me\\neverywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n        Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\\nto worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n        “But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n        “Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n         Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes\\nwhen he said that.\\n         “How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot —\\ngreat with animals.”\\n          Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While\\nRon told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece\\nof paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the\\nDaily Prophet:\\n\\n    GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n    Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely\\nbelieved to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n    Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that\\nwas searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n    “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you\\nknow what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\n\\n    Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob\\nGringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.\\n        “Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\\nIt might’ve been happening while we were there!”\\n        There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes\\nthis time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story\\nagain. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same\\nday. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it\\nemptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves\\n\\x0cwere looking for?\\n         As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\\nweighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought\\nthat none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as\\ntea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it\\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell\\nHarry?\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                           CHAPTER NINE\\n\\n   THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n\\n     H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had\\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or\\nat least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on\\nThursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n        “Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool\\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”\\n        He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n            “You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron\\nreasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at\\nQuidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”\\n         Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about\\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful\\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in\\nhelicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it,\\nhe’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his\\nbroomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d\\nalmost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding\\nfamilies talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument\\nwith Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see\\nwhat was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to\\nfly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team,\\ntrying to make the players move.\\n            Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good\\nreason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents\\neven with both feet on the ground.\\n          Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.\\nThis was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she\\nhadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips\\nshe’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville\\n\\x0cwas hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him\\nhang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when\\nHermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\n           Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always\\nbringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the\\nSlytherin table.\\n         A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He\\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble,\\nwhich seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n         “It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this\\ntells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like\\nthis and if it turns red — oh…” His face fell, because the Remembrall had\\nsuddenly glowed scarlet, “…you’ve forgotten something….”\\n        Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\n         Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\\nto fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than\\nany teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n        “What’s going on?”\\n        “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”\\n        Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n           “Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle\\nbehind him.\\n\\n    At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried\\ndown the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the\\nsloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to\\nthe forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n        The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain\\nabout the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew\\ntoo high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\n           Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\n         “Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a\\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.”\\n        Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\\n\\x0cout at odd angles.\\n         “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the\\nfront, “and say ‘Up!’”\\n         “UP” everyone shouted.\\n          Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\\nthat did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and\\nNeville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you\\nwere afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only\\ntoo clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\n           Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without\\nsliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong\\nfor years.\\n         “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said\\nMadam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two\\n—”\\n            But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.\\n         “Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\\ncork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared\\nwhite face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways\\noff the broom and —\\n           WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\\ngrass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to\\ndrift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\n         Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n          “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right,\\nup you get.”\\n         She turned to the rest of the class.\\n          “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\\nleave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can\\nsay ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”\\n            Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\n         No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n         “Did you see his face, the great lump?”\\n         The other Slytherins joined in.\\n         “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.\\n\\x0c         “Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\\nSlytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\\n        “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\\ngrass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”\\n        The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n        “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to\\nwatch.\\n        Malfoy smiled nastily.\\n         “I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about —\\nup a tree?”\\n          “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\\nand taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the\\ntopmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”\\n        Harry grabbed his broom.\\n          “No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move\\n— you’ll get us all into trouble.”\\n           Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the\\nbroom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\\nthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce\\njoy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this\\nwas easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even\\nhigher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\\nwhoop from Ron.\\n           He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy\\nlooked stunned.\\n        “Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”\\n        “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\n          Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the\\nbroom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy\\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the\\nbroom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n        “No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.\\n        The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n         “Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high\\ninto the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n         Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then\\nstart to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next\\nsecond he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled\\nin his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his\\n\\x0chand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom\\nstraight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched\\nsafely in his fist.\\n        “HARRY POTTER!”\\n          His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was\\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n        “Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”\\n        Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\\nflashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —”\\n        “It wasn’t his fault, Professor —”\\n        “Be quiet, Miss Patil —”\\n        “But Malfoy —”\\n        “That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”\\n          Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as\\nhe left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward\\nthe castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say\\nsomething to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his\\nvoice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;\\nhe had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks.\\nHe’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he\\nturned up on the doorstep?\\n           Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\\nMcGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking\\nhim to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he\\nimagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\\n         Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\\nand poked her head inside.\\n        “Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?”\\n          Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to\\nuse on him?\\n         But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\\nof Flitwick’s class looking confused.\\n         “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\\nup the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n        “In here.”\\n          Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty\\n\\x0cexcept for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n           “Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the\\ndoor behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n        “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”\\n        Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n        “Are you serious, Professor?”\\n          “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural.\\nI’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,\\nPotter?”\\n          Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he\\ndidn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\\nhis legs.\\n            “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor\\nMcGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t\\nhave done it.”\\n        Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n        “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n             “Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall\\nexplained.\\n          “He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around\\nHarry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent\\nbroom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n        “I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-\\nyear rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that\\nlast match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…”\\n        Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n          “I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\\nabout punishing you.”\\n        Then she suddenly smiled.\\n           “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent\\nQuidditch player himself.”\\n\\n   “You’re joking.”\\n       It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\\nwhen he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak\\nand kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.\\n         “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest\\nhouse player in about —”\\n\\x0c              “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt\\nparticularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\\n         Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n           “I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood\\nwants to keep it a secret.”\\n            Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\\nhurried over.\\n           “Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the\\nteam too — Beaters.”\\n          “I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said\\nFred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be\\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n           “Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret\\npassageway out of the school.”\\n          “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\\nin our first week. See you.”\\n          Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\\nturned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n           “Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\\nMuggles?”\\n          “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got\\nyour little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at\\nall little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,\\nneither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n            “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you\\nwant. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard\\nof a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n           “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s\\nyours?”\\n         Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n            “Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy\\nroom; that’s always unlocked.”\\n         When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\n           “What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re\\nmy second?”\\n          “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting\\nstarted at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added\\nquickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\\nmost you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you\\n\\x0cknows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse,\\nanyway.”\\n        “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n        “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\\n        “Excuse me.”\\n        They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n        “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\n        Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n        “I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\\n        “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n         “— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of\\nthe points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s\\nreally very selfish of you.”\\n        “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n        “Good-bye,” said Ron.\\n\\n    All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry\\nthought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep\\n(Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving\\nhim advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I\\ncan’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were\\ngoing to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his\\nluck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering\\nface kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat\\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\\n        “Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”\\n         They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\\nthe tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs\\ninto hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\\nvoice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this,\\nHarry.”\\n         A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\\nand a frown.\\n        “You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\\n        “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect,\\nhe’d put a stop to this.”\\n        Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n        “Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\\n\\x0cand climbed through the hole.\\n         Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\\nthe portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n          “Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\\ndon’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got\\nfrom Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.”\\n        “Go away.”\\n         “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re\\non the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”\\n           But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the\\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty\\npainting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked\\nout of Gryffindor tower.\\n        “Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\\n          “That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be\\nlate.”\\n         They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught\\nup with them.\\n        “I’m coming with you,” she said.\\n        “You are not.”\\n         “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\\nIf he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and\\nyou can back me up.”\\n        “You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\\n        “Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.”\\n        It was a sort of snuffling.\\n        “Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\n         It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast\\nasleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n         “Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t\\nremember the new password to get in to bed.”\\n         “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t\\nhelp you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”\\n        “How’s your arm?” said Harry.\\n            “Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in\\nabout a minute.”\\n         “Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you\\nlater —”\\n          “Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to\\n\\x0cstay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”\\n            Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\\nNeville.\\n         “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse\\nof the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”\\n          Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\\nforward.\\n         They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high\\nwindows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the\\ntrophy room.\\n              Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases\\nglimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping\\ntheir eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case\\nMalfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n         “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\\n            Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\\nraised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\\n         “Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\\n          It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently\\ntoward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped\\nround the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\n         “They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”\\n           “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he\\ntripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a\\nsuit of armor.\\n         The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n         “RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the\\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without\\nany idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a\\ntapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came\\nout near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy\\nroom.\\n\\x0c         “I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and\\nwiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\n         I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\\n“I — told — you.”\\n            “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as\\npossible.”\\n          “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t\\nyou? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in\\nthe trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”\\n        Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.\\n        “Let’s go.”\\n          It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen\\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom\\nin front of them.\\n        It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n        “Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”\\n        Peeves cackled.\\n           “Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\\nnaughty, you’ll get caughty.”\\n        “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”\\n         “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes\\nglittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”\\n         “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\\nbig mistake.\\n         “STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF\\nBED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”\\n           Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\\ncorridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\\n         “This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re\\ndone for! This is the end!”\\n             They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward\\nPeeves’s shouts.\\n         “Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped\\nthe lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”\\n         The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut\\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n        “Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”\\n        “Say ‘please.’”\\n        “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”\\n\\x0c         “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying\\nsingsong voice.\\n         “All right — please.”\\n         “NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say\\nplease! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away\\nand Filch cursing in rage.\\n         “He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay\\n— get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s\\nbathrobe for the last minute. “What?”\\n          Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\\nwas sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of\\neverything that had happened so far.\\n          They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor.\\nThe forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\\nforbidden.\\n          They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\\nof rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\\ndrooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\n          It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\\nthat the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance\\nhad taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\\nmistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\n           Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take\\nFilch.\\n          They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\\nalmost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\\nthem somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly\\ncared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\\nand that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the\\nFat Lady on the seventh floor.\\n             “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their\\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n         “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait\\nswung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,\\ntrembling, into armchairs.\\n         It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\\nas if he’d never speak again.\\n         “What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in\\n\\x0ca school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\n        Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You\\ndon’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it\\nwas standing on.\\n          “The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too\\nbusy with its heads.”\\n        “No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding\\nsomething.”\\n       She stood up, glaring at them.\\n       “I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed —\\nor worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\n       Ron stared after her, his mouth open.\\n           “No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,\\nwouldn’t you.\\n           But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he\\nclimbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something…What had Hagrid\\nsaid? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\\nhide — except perhaps Hogwarts.\\n        It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package\\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                            CHAPTER TEN\\n\\n   HALLOWEEN\\n\\n    M alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still\\nat Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\\nbeen an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\\nthe meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\\nmoved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\\ncould possibly need such heavy protection.\\n        “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n        “Or both,” said Harry.\\n        But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\\nabout two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was\\nwithout further clues.\\n         Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going\\nnear the dog again.\\n        Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\\na bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\\nthing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n          As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention\\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\\nHarry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\\nand was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\\nanother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n        Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n\\n    DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\n                It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want\\neverybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver\\nWood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first\\ntraining session.\\n\\x0c           Professor McGonagall\\n\\n     Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\n          “A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even\\ntouched one.”\\n          They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\\nbefore their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\\nfelt it.\\n         “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\\nof jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\\naren’t allowed them.”\\n         Ron couldn’t resist it.\\n          “It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nWhat did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron\\ngrinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the\\nNimbus.”\\n          “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the\\nhandle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up\\ntwig by twig.”\\n            Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s\\nelbow.\\n         “Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\\n         “Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.\\n            “Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\\n“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\\nwhat model is it?”\\n         “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\\nlook of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve\\ngot it,” he added.\\n          Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s\\nobvious rage and confusion.\\n          “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble\\nstaircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.\\n…”\\n          “So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an\\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.\\n\\x0c         “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n         “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\n         Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n          Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that\\nnight. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\\nand then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n         “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\n           Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n         As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\\ntoward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\\nof seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\\nenough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\\nMuggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n          Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the\\ngoal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\\nturned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n         “Hey, Potter, come down!”\\n         Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\\narm. Harry landed next to him.\\n            “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall\\nmeant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this\\nevening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\\n         He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n         “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\\nif it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\\nare called Chasers.”\\n           “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\n           “This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\\nTen points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\\n          “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,”\\nHarry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six\\n\\x0choops, isn’t it?”\\n        “What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\\n        “Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\\n        “Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m\\nKeeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\\nfrom scoring.”\\n            “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to\\nremember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\\nthey for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n        “I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\\n        He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n         “I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two\\nare the Bludgers.”\\n         He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\\nstraps holding them inside the box.\\n         “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\\nBludgers.\\n          At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\\nHarry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\\nsent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then\\nshot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\n         “See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\\nand strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\\nplayers off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the\\nWeasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\\nand try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\\n          “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\\noff.\\n        “Very good,” said Wood.\\n         “Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he\\nsounded offhand.\\n          “Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\\nworse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And\\nyou don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\\n        “— unless they crack my head open.”\\n         “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I\\nmean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”\\n\\x0c            Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\\nlarge walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\n        “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball\\nof the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the\\nSeeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\\nBludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because\\nwhichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\\npoints, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A\\ngame of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\\n— I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\\nthe players could get some sleep.\\n        “Well, that’s it any questions?”\\n         Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\\n        “We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it\\nback inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few\\nof these.”\\n           He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\\nhard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n          Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\\n           “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood\\nhappily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn\\nout better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\\nhadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\n    Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\\nbelieve it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The\\ncastle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\\nbecoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n           On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\\npumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\\nannounced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\\nsomething they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s\\ntoad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\\npractice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\\n\\x0cNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\\nHermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\\nabout this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick\\nhad arrived.\\n           “Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!”\\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\\n“Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\\nproperly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’\\ninstead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\\n           It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\\nSeamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it —\\nHarry had to put it out with his hat.\\n         Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\\n             “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a\\nwindmill.\\n          “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-\\ndium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\\n         “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\\n          Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\\n“Wingardium Leviosa!”\\n          Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\\nheads.\\n         “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here,\\nMiss Granger’s done it!”\\n         Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n          “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed\\ntheir way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\n         Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in\\ntears.\\n         “I think she heard you.”\\n         “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed\\nshe’s got no friends.”\\n         Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon.\\nOn their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\\noverheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\\nthe girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward\\nat this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\\n\\x0cdecorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n        A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\\nmore swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at\\nthe start-of-term banquet.\\n         Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table,\\nand gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\\n        He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n         There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\\nthe end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\\n            “Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories\\nimmediately!”\\n        Percy was in his element.\\n          “Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you\\nfollow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming\\nthrough! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”\\n        “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n         “Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe\\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”\\n          They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\\nsuddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.\\n        “I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\\n        “What about her?”\\n        “She doesn’t know about the troll.”\\n        Ron bit his lip.\\n        “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”\\n         Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\\ndown a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They\\nhad just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\\n        “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n        Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\\ncorridor and disappeared from view.\\n            “What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the\\ndungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\\n        “Search me.”\\n           Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s\\n\\x0cfading footsteps.\\n         “He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\\n         “Can you smell something?”\\n           Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n          And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\\ngigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\\nwas moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\\nemerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n          It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\\nits great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\\ncoming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\n         The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\\nears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n         “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\\n         “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\\n           They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t\\nabout to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\\nslam the door, and lock it.\\n         “Yes!”\\n         Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\\nthey reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a\\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just\\nchained up.\\n         “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n         “It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\\n         “Hermione!” they said together.\\n          It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\\nWheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\\ntheir panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\n         Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\\nshe was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\\nwalls as it went.\\n         “Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\\nit as hard as he could against the wall.\\n         The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\\nstupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\\n\\x0chesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\\n          “Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\\nthrew a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\\nRon instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\\n         “Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\\nthe door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\\nopen with terror.\\n           The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\\nroared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\\n          Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck\\nfrom behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\\nnotice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been\\nin his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.\\n            Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\\nhim a terrible blow with the club.\\n          Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\\n— not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\\ncame into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”\\n         The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the\\nair, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s\\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\\nmade the whole room tremble.\\n            Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\\nstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\n         It was Hermione who spoke first.\\n         “Is it — dead?”\\n         “I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”\\n         He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered\\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n         “Urgh — troll boogers.”\\n         He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.\\n          A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\\nThey hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\\nsomeone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment\\nlater, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed\\nby Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,\\n\\x0clet out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n         Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\\nHarry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of\\nwinning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.\\n         “What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with\\ncold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his\\nwand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your\\ndormitory?”\\n           Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\\nwished Ron would put his wand down.\\n         Then a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n         “Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”\\n         “Miss Granger!”\\n         Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n         “I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on\\nmy own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”\\n           Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\\nteacher?\\n          “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its\\nnose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come\\nand fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”\\n         Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.\\n          “Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three\\nof them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\\nmountain troll on your own?”\\n          Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\\nperson to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\\n          “Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,\\nyou’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their\\nhouses.”\\n         Hermione left.\\n         Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n           “Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\\ntaken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points.\\nProfessor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”\\n           They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had\\nclimbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite\\n\\x0capart from anything else.\\n        “We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.\\n        “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”\\n          “Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind\\nyou, we did save her.”\\n         “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with\\nher,” Harry reminded him.\\n        They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n        “Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\n         The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food\\nthat had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for\\nthem. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each\\nother, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\\n         But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There\\nare some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and\\nknocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                        CHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\n   QUIDDITCH\\n\\n    A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning\\nthe ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows\\ndefrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin\\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\n         The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing\\nin his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house\\nchampionship.\\n          Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was\\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was\\nworse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be\\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n          It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t\\nknow how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all\\nthe last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent\\nhim Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\\n            Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in\\n1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most\\nserious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people\\nrarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up\\nmonths later in the Sahara Desert.\\n            Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since\\nHarry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\\nfor it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in\\nthe freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue\\nfire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their\\nbacks to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once\\nthat Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to\\nblock the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately,\\n\\x0csomething about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He\\nhadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\\nanyway.\\n        “What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”\\n        It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n        “Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape. “Give\\nit to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”\\n          “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\\naway. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”\\n        “Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.\\n\\n    The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\\nRon’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (“How will\\nyou learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers\\nanyway.\\n         Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape?\\nGetting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could\\nhave it.\\n            “Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\nSnape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\n           He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no\\nanswer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\n          Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\\nthe door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\n          Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\\nhis knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\nbandages.\\n         “Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep your\\neyes on all three heads at once?”\\n         Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n         “POTTER!”\\n           Snape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\\nhide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n         “I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n         “GET OUT! OUT!”\\n         Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He\\nsprinted back upstairs.\\n\\x0c         “Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?”\\n         In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n          “You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get\\npast that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we\\nsaw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let\\nthat troll in, to make a diversion!”\\n         Hermione’s eyes were wide.\\n             “No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he\\nwouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n           “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,”\\nsnapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s\\nhe after? What’s that dog guarding?”\\n         Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he\\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but\\nthe expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to\\nforget.\\n\\n    The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking\\nforward to a good Quidditch match.\\n        “You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”\\n        “I don’t want anything.”\\n        “Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.\\n        “I’m not hungry.”\\n        Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.\\n          “Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are\\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”\\n          “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\nsausages.\\n\\n    By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised\\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\n         Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan\\nup in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one\\nof the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who\\nwas good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then\\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different\\n\\x0ccolors.\\n           Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in\\ngreen).\\n        Wood cleared his throat for silence.\\n        “Okay, men,” he said.\\n        “And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n        “And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n        “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n        “The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n         “We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the\\nteam last year.”\\n         “Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had\\nin years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\n        He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n        “Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\n         Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his\\nknees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n           Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field\\nwaiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n         “Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all\\ngathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to\\nthe Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if\\nhe had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering\\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart\\nskipped. He felt braver.\\n        “Mount your brooms, please.”\\n        Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n        Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\n        Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\\n             “And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of\\nGryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too —”\\n        “JORDAN!”\\n        “Sorry, Professor.”\\n          The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for\\nthe match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n         “And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a\\ngood find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and —\\nno, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains\\n\\x0cthe Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to\\nsc— no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the\\nGryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice\\ndive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in\\nthe back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second\\nBludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice\\nplay by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the\\nQuaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a\\nspeeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina —\\nKeeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”\\n          Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the\\nSlytherins.\\n        “Budge up there, move along.”\\n        “Hagrid!”\\n          Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to\\njoin them.\\n            “Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of\\nbinoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign\\nof the Snitch yet, eh?”\\n        “Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”\\n          “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his\\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\n         Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about\\nfor some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s game plan.\\n        “Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said.\\n“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”\\n        When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he\\ncaught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the\\nWeasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way,\\nmore like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley\\ncame chasing after it.\\n           “All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\\n         “Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks\\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a\\nmoment — was that the Snitch?”\\n         A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,\\n\\x0ctoo busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left\\near.\\n          Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck\\nthey hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what\\nthey were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\\n          Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings\\nfluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed —\\n          WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus\\nFlint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry\\nholding on for dear life.\\n         “Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.\\n          Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch\\nhad disappeared from sight again.\\n          Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red\\ncard!”\\n         “What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n          “Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red card\\nand you’re out of the game!”\\n         “But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\n         Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n         “They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.”\\n         Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n         “So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”\\n         “Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n         “I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”\\n         “Jordan, I’m warning you —”\\n         “All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could\\nhappen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who\\nputs it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”\\n              It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning\\ndangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,\\nfrightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped\\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like\\nthat.\\n          It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.\\nHarry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mind\\n\\x0cto ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was\\ncompletely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It\\nwas zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing\\nmovements that almost unseated him.\\n        Lee was still commentating.\\n         “Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet —\\npasses Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only\\njoking, Professor — Slytherins score — A no…”\\n           The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that\\nHarry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away\\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n           “Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared\\nthrough his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his\\nbroom…but he can’t have.…”\\n           Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.\\nThen the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry\\nswung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\n            “Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus\\nwhispered.\\n          “Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing interfere\\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a\\nNimbus Two Thousand.”\\n           At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of\\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n        “What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n        “I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”\\n           Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under\\nhis breath.\\n        “He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.\\n        “What should we do?”\\n        “Leave it to me.”\\n          Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron\\nturned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its\\nfeet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely\\nonto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the\\nbroom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,\\n\\x0cobviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and\\nscored five times without anyone noticing.\\n        “Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.\\n        Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\\nwas now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as\\nshe knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape,\\nshe crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.\\n         It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A\\nsudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little\\njar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know\\nwhat had happened.\\n        It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\\nto his broom.\\n             “Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\\nHagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.\\n         Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all\\nfours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.\\n        “I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game\\nended in complete confusion.\\n           “He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling\\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules\\nand Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by\\none hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and\\nHermione.\\n         “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was\\ncursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”\\n          “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on\\nnext to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”\\n         Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\\nhim. Harry decided on the truth.\\n         “I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past\\nthat three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\\nwhatever it’s guarding.”\\n        Hagrid dropped the teapot.\\n        “How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.\\n        “Fluffy?”\\n\\x0c          “Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\\nlas’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”\\n         “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.\\n           “Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top secret,\\nthat is.”\\n         “But Snape’s trying to steal it.”\\n            “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do\\nnothin’ of the sort.”\\n         “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.\\n          The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\\nSnape.\\n          “I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve\\ngot to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”\\n            “I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why\\nHarry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now,\\nlisten to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s\\ndangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between\\nProfessor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel —”\\n          “Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,\\nis there?”\\n         Hagrid looked furious with himself.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                        CHAPTER TWELVE\\n\\n   THE MIRROR OF ERISED\\n\\n    C hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to\\nfind itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley\\ntwins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed\\nQuirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed\\nto battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back\\nto health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\n            No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor\\ncommon room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had\\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all\\nwere Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in\\na mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n         “I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those\\npeople who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted\\nat home.”\\n         He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.\\nHarry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy\\nhad been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted\\nthat the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-\\nmouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized\\nthat nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way\\nHarry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and\\nangry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\n         It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at\\nonce. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best\\nChristmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\n         When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir\\ntree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom\\nand a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n          “Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through the\\n\\x0cbranches.\\n        “Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”\\n          “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl\\nfrom behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping\\nto be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of\\nHagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”\\n        Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n        “WEASLEY!”\\n        Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.\\n           “He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge\\nhairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”\\n           “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said\\nSnape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t\\nmore. Move along, all of you.”\\n           Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering\\nneedles everywhere and smirking.\\n          “I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of\\nthese days, I’ll get him —”\\n        “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”\\n        “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what,\\ncome with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”\\n         So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall,\\nwhere Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the\\nChristmas decorations.\\n        “Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”\\n          The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\\naround the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around\\nthe room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of\\ncandles.\\n        “How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.\\n         “Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve\\ngot half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”\\n         “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor\\nFlitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\\nthem over the branches of the new tree.\\n         “The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before\\nthe holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n           “Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you\\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”\\n\\x0c          “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh —\\ndrop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\\n         “We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\\n         “Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We\\nmust’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him\\nanywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\\n         “I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\\n         “Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid\\nlooking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n           They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since\\nHagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\\nwas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,\\nnot knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t\\nin Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our\\nTime; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A\\nStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the\\nsheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\\nhundreds of narrow rows.\\n          Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search\\nwhile Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the\\nshelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been\\nwondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the\\nrestricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books\\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\\nolder students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n         “What are you looking for, boy?”\\n         “Nothing,” said Harry.\\n         Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\n         “You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”\\n         Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\\nlibrary. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam\\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them,\\nbut they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\n          Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\\nanything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\\nafter A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising\\nthey’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\\nMadam Pince breathing down their necks.\\n\\x0c         Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\\nThey went off to lunch.\\n          “You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione.\\n“And send me an owl if you find anything.”\\n        “And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron.\\n“It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n        “Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\n\\n    Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\\nthink much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\\narmchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\\ntoasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of\\ngetting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t\\nwork.\\n          Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\\ndirecting troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything\\nelse he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this\\ncase, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron\\nknew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\n          Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\\ndidn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting\\ndifferent bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t\\nyou see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”\\n        On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for\\nthe food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early\\nin the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\\nthe foot of his bed.\\n         “Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\\npulled on his bathrobe.\\n        “You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”\\n        “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\\nwas a lot bigger than Harry’s.\\n         Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit\\nlike an owl.\\n        A second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n\\x0c          We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\n        “That’s friendly,” said Harry.\\n        Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n        “Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”\\n         “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid\\nand my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”\\n          “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and\\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any\\npresents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”\\n          Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n          “Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own,\\n“and mine’s always maroon.”\\n         “That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\\ntasty.\\n         His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs\\nfrom Hermione.\\n         This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\\nHe unwrapped it.\\n         Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\\nin gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n           “I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\nEvery Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is —\\nthey’re really rare, and really valuable.”\\n        “What is it?”\\n         Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\\ntouch, like water woven into material.\\n         “It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure\\nit is — try it on.”\\n        Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n        “It is! Look down!”\\n           Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\\nin midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\\nhis reflection vanished completely.\\n        “There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\\n         Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\\nwriting he had never seen before were the following words:\\n\\x0c   Your father left this in my possession before he died.\\n   It is time it was returned to you.\\n   Use it well.\\n   A Very Merry Christmas to you.\\n\\n     There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\\ncloak.\\n            “I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the\\nmatter?”\\n         “Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\\nit really once belonged to his father?\\n         Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\\nout of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\n         “Merry Christmas!”\\n         “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\\n          Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\\non it, the other a G.\\n            “Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s\\nsweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”\\n           “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on,\\nget it on, they’re lovely and warm.”\\n         “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\\n           “You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose she\\nthinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re\\ncalled Gred and Forge.”\\n         “What’s all this noise?”\\n         Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\n          “P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even\\nHarry got one.”\\n            “I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\\nsweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\n            “And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.\\n“Christmas is a time for family.”\\n          They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\\nhis sweater.\\n\\x0c    Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\\nroast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce –\\nand stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\\nparty favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\\nbought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\\npulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast\\nlike a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\\ninside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\\nTable, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet,\\nand was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\\n         Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\\nProfessor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and\\nblushed, her top hat lopsided.\\n          When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\\nwhite mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\\nend up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.\\n            Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\\nsnowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\\nnew chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have\\nlost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\n         After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\\nPercy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his\\nprefect badge.\\n          It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\\nfree to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n         Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\\nfell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\n         His father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his\\nhands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\\n\\x0c           He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\\nIt was a very funny feeling.\\n        Use it well.\\n          Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\\nhim in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\\nknow.\\n          Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\\nback — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted\\nto use it alone.\\n         He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\\n          “Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\\nquickly down the corridor.\\n         Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long\\nas he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\\ninvisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\\n          The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\\nmidair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\\nhim the creeps.\\n           The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\\nheld up his lamp to read the titles.\\n           They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\nwords in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One\\nbook had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\\nof Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\\na faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\\nwas there who shouldn’t be.\\n         He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\\nvery heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\\n            A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\\nunbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,\\n\\x0cwhich went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\\noutside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\\nFilch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\\nHarry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\\nbook’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\\n         He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\\nbusy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was\\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all.\\nThere was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\\nabove there.\\n             “You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\nwandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted\\nSection.”\\n          Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\\nhorror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be\\nfar, we’ll catch them.”\\n         Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\\nahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\\ncame much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak didn’t stop him from\\nbeing solid.\\n          He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\\nmove it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\\nnoticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\\nbreathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\\nvery close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\\nhad hidden in.\\n         It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but\\npropped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it\\nbelonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\\nit out of the way.\\n          It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\\ntop: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\\nwas no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\\nlook at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\n         He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\\n\\x0cwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\\nhad screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\\ncrowd of people standing right behind him.\\n          But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\\nthe mirror.\\n            There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder —\\nbut still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\\nroom full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them,\\ninvisible or not?\\n            He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\\nbehind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so\\nclose together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\n         She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her\\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\\nsmiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\\nnext to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\\nuntidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\\n          Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\\nthat of his reflection.\\n         “Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\\n         They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\\nof the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\\nnoses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s\\nknobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\\n          The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\\nright through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\\njoy, half terrible sadness.\\n          How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade\\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\\nHe couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\\nfrom his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\\n\\n   “You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\\n      “You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\\n      “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\\n\\x0c         “And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.”\\n        “You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house\\nthis summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\\nfinding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating\\nanything?”\\n         Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\\nagain tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very\\nimportant anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What\\ndid it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n        “Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\\n\\n    What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more\\nslowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library,\\nwandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n       “I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”\\n       “No!” Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”\\n       They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but\\nsaw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\\nHarry spotted the suit of armor.\\n       “It’s here — just here — yes!”\\n         They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.\\n       There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\n       “See?” Harry whispered.\\n       “I can’t see anything.”\\n       “Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”\\n       “I can only see you.”\\n       “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”\\n        Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see\\nhis family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\n       Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n       “Look at me!” he said.\\n       “Can you see all your family standing around you?”\\n        “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m head\\nboy!”\\n       “What?”\\n        “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the\\n\\x0chouse cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too.”\\n          Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\\nHarry.\\n       “Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n       “How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\\n       “You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”\\n        “You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I\\nwant to see my parents.”\\n       “Don’t push me —”\\n         A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\\nThey hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n       “Quick!”\\n        Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\\ncame round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same\\nthing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\\nleft.\\n         “This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\\nCome on.”\\n       And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n\\n    The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n        “Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n        “No.”\\n        “Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n        “No…you go…”\\n          “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back\\ntonight.”\\n        “Why not?”\\n         “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had\\ntoo many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering\\naround. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you\\nknock something over?”\\n        “You sound like Hermione.”\\n        “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\n          But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.\\n\\n    That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking\\nso fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet\\n\\x0canyone.\\n          And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\\nhis grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of\\nthe mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his\\nfamily. Nothing at all.\\n        Except —\\n        “So — back again, Harry?”\\n         Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him.\\nSitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.\\nHarry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he\\nhadn’t noticed him.\\n        “I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n               “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said\\nDumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n           “So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\\nHarry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\\nof Erised.”\\n        “I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\\n        “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n        “It — well — it shows me my family —”\\n        “And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\\n        “How did you know —?”\\n            “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.\\n“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\\n        Harry shook his head.\\n           “Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see\\nhimself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\n             Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want…\\nwhatever we want…”\\n        “Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less\\nthan the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\\nknown your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has\\nalways been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men\\nhave wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven\\nmad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n          “The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask\\nyou not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be\\n\\x0cprepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\\nNow, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”\\n       Harry stood up.\\n       “Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”\\n       “Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me\\none more thing, however.”\\n       “What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\\n       “I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”\\n       Harry stared.\\n           “One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another\\nChristmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on\\ngiving me books.”\\n            It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that\\nDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he\\nshoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                      CHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\n   NICHOLAS FLAMEL\\n\\n    D umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised\\nagain, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed\\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in\\nthe mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and\\nover again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light,\\nwhile a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n         “You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said\\nRon, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n          Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of\\nbed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and\\ndisappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n         They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book,\\neven though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had\\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their\\nbreaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice\\nhad started again.\\n         Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\\nhad replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained\\nthat Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won\\ntheir next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house\\nchampionship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,\\nHarry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\n           Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood\\ngave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys,\\nwho kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n          “Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly the sort of\\nthing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking\\nfor any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”\\n        George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n         “Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s\\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might\\n\\x0covertake Slytherin.”\\n        The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n         “It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a\\nclean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”\\n         Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n        The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end\\nof practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,\\nwhere he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing\\nHermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n        “Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to\\nhim, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n        “What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n        Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two\\nabout Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n        “Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n        “Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n        “Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n        “Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n           “I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\\nGryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n          At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had\\nmanaged to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs\\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker\\nCurse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\n            Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and\\nperformed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,\\ntrembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with\\nHarry and Ron.\\n         “Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He said\\nhe’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”\\n        “Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!”\\n        Neville shook his head.\\n        “I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.\\n           “You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to\\nwalking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and\\nmake it easier.”\\n         “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\\nMalfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.\\n\\x0c         Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the\\nvery last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n           “You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose\\nyou for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”\\n         Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\\n            “Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you\\ncollect them, don’t you?”\\n         As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n         “Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\\n          He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\\nand Hermione.\\n          “I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read\\nthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this:\\n‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard\\nGrindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and\\nhis work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\\n          Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d\\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n             “Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’\\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before\\nshe was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n         “I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out\\nof the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\\n         “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked\\nsomething up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to\\nherself.\\n         At last she found what she was looking for.\\n         “I knew it! I knew it!”\\n           “Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\nhim.\\n         “Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker\\nof the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\n         This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n         “The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n         “Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\n         She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n\\n   The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone,\\n\\x0ca legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any\\nmetal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the\\ndrinker immortal.\\n     There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but\\nthe only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted\\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-\\nfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six\\nhundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n    “See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be\\nguarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe\\nfor him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he\\nwanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”\\n         “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.\\n“No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n           “And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent\\nDevelopments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six\\nhundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\n    The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing\\nwhat they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said\\nhe’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the\\ncoming match.\\n          “I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the\\nSlytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll\\nreally wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n        “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\n    As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm,\\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\\nwonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to,\\nwith such a biased referee?\\n        Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether\\nSnape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were\\nturning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could\\nSnape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t\\n\\x0csee how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could\\nread minds.\\n\\n    Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see\\nhim alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a\\nword of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his\\nNimbus Two Thousand.\\n         Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\\nNeville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why\\nthey had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron\\nand Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten\\nthe idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he\\nshowed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n         “Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron\\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n        “I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n        Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n        “Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture\\nof the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too\\nmuch.”\\n          “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\\ndoor. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”\\n        Harry’s heart did a somersault.\\n        “Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.\\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard.\\n         Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was\\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\\nwatching.\\n        Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\\nonto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n           “I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look —\\nthey’re off. Ouch!”\\n        Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\n        “Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”\\n        Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n        “Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone\\nwant a bet? What about you, Weasley?”\\n        Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\\n\\x0cGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers\\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game\\nlike a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n          “You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?”\\nsaid Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\\npenalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter,\\nwho’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you\\nshould be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\n        Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n        “I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\n            Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n           “Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and\\nthat’s saying something.”\\n          Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\\nabout Harry.\\n        “I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n        “Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n        “What? Where?”\\n         Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and\\ncheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as\\nHarry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n         “You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on the\\nground!” said Malfoy.\\n         Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top\\nof him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the\\nback of his seat to help.\\n          “Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch\\nas Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling\\naround under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists\\nthat was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\n            Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second,\\nHarry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in\\nhis hand.\\n        The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the\\nSnitch being caught so quickly.\\n         “Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve won!\\nGryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat\\n\\x0cand hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\n        Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn’t believe\\nit. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As\\nGryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced\\nand tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into\\nDumbledore’s smiling face.\\n         “Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.\\n“Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror...been keeping\\nbusy...excellent...”\\n        Snape spat bitterly on the ground.\\n\\n    Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\\nThousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling happier.\\nHe’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a\\nfamous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked\\nover the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:\\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the\\ndistance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\n          Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and\\nlooked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.\\nGryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape ....\\n        And speaking of Snape…\\n         A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly\\nnot wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.\\nHarry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure’s\\nprowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\\n— what was going on?\\n         Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding\\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\n         The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He flew\\nin circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard\\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\\n          He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\\n         Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone. Quirrell\\nwas there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was\\nstuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\n           “…d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\\nSeverus…”\\n\\x0c           “Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy.\\n“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”\\n             Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape\\ninterrupted him.\\n        “Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?”\\n        “B-b-but Severus, I —”\\n         “You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step\\ntoward him.\\n        “I-I don’t know what you—”\\n        “You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\n         An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied\\nhimself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m\\nwaiting.”\\n        “B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n          “Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when\\nyou’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\n         He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he\\nwas petrified.\\n\\n    “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n          “We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the\\nback. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and\\nGoyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all\\nright — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room,\\nwe’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the\\nkitchens.”\\n          “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty\\nroom, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\n        He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them,\\nthen he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n        “So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force\\nQuirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he\\nsaid something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things\\nguarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and\\nQuirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break\\nthrough —”\\n          “So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\\nSnape?” said Hermione in alarm.\\n\\x0c“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                      CHAPTER FOURTEEN\\n\\n   NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\n\\n    Q uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks\\nthat followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as\\nthough he’d cracked yet.\\n             Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still\\ngrowling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which\\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these\\ndays he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.\\n          Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.\\nShe had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry\\nand Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\\n        “Hermione, the exams are ages away.”\\n        “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a second to\\nNicolas Flamel.”\\n           “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway,\\nwhat are you studying for, you already know it’s an A.”\\n          “What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\\nthese exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have\\nstarted studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.…”\\n        Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as\\nHermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays\\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with\\nHermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing\\nwand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free\\ntime in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\\n         “I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really\\nfine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and\\nthere was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\\n          Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs\\nand Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing\\n\\x0cin the library?”\\n          Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked\\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\\n           “Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.\\n“An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still\\nlookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”\\n         “Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “And we\\nknow what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St—”\\n          “Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.\\n“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”\\n          “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said\\nHarry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”\\n         “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not\\npromisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here,\\nstudents aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”\\n         “See you later, then,” said Harry.\\n         Hagrid shuffled off.\\n         “What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.\\n         “Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”\\n          “I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough\\nof working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and\\nslammed them down on the table.\\n          “Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\\nLook at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\\nInferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”\\n         “Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met\\nhim, “ said Harry.\\n         “But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by\\nthe Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop\\nMuggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden —\\nanyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns\\nCharlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”\\n         “But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.\\n          “Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\\nBlacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our\\nkind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them\\nforget.”\\n         “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.\\n\\x0c     When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they\\nwere surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?”\\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\n         It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was\\na blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\\nsandwiches, which they refused.\\n         “So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”\\n         “Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were\\nwondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from\\nFluffy.”\\n         Hagrid frowned at him.\\n          “O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number\\ntwo, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s\\nhere fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve\\nworked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”\\n          “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\\nyou know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm,\\nflattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We\\nonly wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We\\nwondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n           Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\\nHermione.\\n             “Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he\\nborrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…\\nProfessor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked\\nthem off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did\\nsomethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\\nSnape.”\\n         “Snape?”\\n         “Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\\nthe Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n           Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\\nSnape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\\nhow the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except,\\nit seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\n           “You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you,\\nHagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not\\neven one of the teachers?”\\n         “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.\\n\\x0c         “Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Hagrid, can we\\nhave a window open? I’m boiling.”\\n         “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\\nHarry looked at it, too.\\n        “Hagrid — what’s that?”\\n        But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\\nthe kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n        “Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er…”\\n        “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\\ncloser look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”\\n        “Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few\\ndrinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\\nget rid of it, ter be honest.”\\n        “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.\\n          “Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book\\nfrom under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for\\nPleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep the\\negg in the fire, ‘cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an’ when it hatches,\\nfeed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see\\nhere — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian\\nRidgeback. They’re rare, them.”\\n        He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n        “Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\n         But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\\nfire.\\n\\n    So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n         “Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening\\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\\nHermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\\nwas driving them nuts.\\n           Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\\nHagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\n        Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\\nwouldn’t hear of it.\\n         “Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\\nhatching?”\\n          “We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what\\n\\x0cHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n        “Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\n        Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\\nmuch had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\n           Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning\\nbreak. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\\nof them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\\nedge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\\n        “It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.\\n         The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\\nwas moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\n        They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\\n         All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\\ndragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\\nlike a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\\nskinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\\nbulging, orange eyes.\\n        It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n         “Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\\nthe dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\\n        “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.\\n           “Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\\nexactly?”\\n          Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his\\nface — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n        “What’s the matter?”\\n          “Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid —\\nhe’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”\\n         Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\\nmistaking him.\\n        Malfoy had seen the dragon.\\n\\n   Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free\\ntime in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\n        “Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”\\n        “I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”\\n         They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\\n\\x0cweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his\\ngamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were\\nempty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\n         “I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\\nwith misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s\\nMommy?”\\n        “He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.\\n         “Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to\\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”\\n        Hagrid bit his lip.\\n        “I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.”\\n        Harry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie.” he said.\\n        “You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”\\n        “No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him\\nback in the wild!”\\n        “Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\\n         And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\\nask him.\\n\\n    The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and\\nHarry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst\\nopen. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak.\\nHe had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now\\neating dead rats by the crate.\\n         “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\\nbloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell\\nyou, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid\\ngoes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he\\ntold me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”\\n        There was a tap on the dark window.\\n         “It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll have Charlie’s\\nanswer!”\\n        The three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\n\\n   Dear Ron,\\n\\n   How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take the Norwegian\\n\\x0cRidgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to\\nsend him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.\\nTrouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\\n   Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?\\nThey can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.\\n   Send me an answer as soon as possible.\\n\\n   Love,\\n   Charlie\\n\\n    They looked at one another.\\n            “We’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be too\\ndifficult – I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”\\n           It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.\\n\\n     There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to\\ntwice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam\\nPomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had\\nno choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s\\nfangs were poisonous.\\n         Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n         “It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about\\nto fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books\\nso he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her\\nwhat really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me\\n— I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.”\\n        Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n         “It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t\\nsoothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\n         “Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no — I’ve\\njust remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to\\nknow we’re getting rid of Norbert.”\\n           Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey\\ncame over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n\\n   “It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We haven’t got\\ntime to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of\\n\\x0cNorbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy\\ndoesn’t know about that.”\\n          They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail\\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\n         “I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I\\ncan’t handle.”\\n          When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with tears,\\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\n        “Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s only a\\nbaby, after all.”\\n         The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry\\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly\\nenough.\\n\\n     They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\\ngood-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do. It\\nwas a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid’s hut\\nbecause they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and\\nready in a large crate.\\n          “He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a\\nmuffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”\\n            From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\\n         “Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy\\nwill never forget you!”\\n           How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in\\nthe entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another\\n– even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.\\n           “Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\\ntallest tower.\\n           Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the\\ncrate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet\\naway. A lamp flared.\\n         Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\\nthe ear.\\n\\x0c        “Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering\\naround in the middle of the night, how dare you —”\\n          “You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a\\ndragon!”\\n        “What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see\\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!”\\n         The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\\nthing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air\\ndid they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione\\ndid a sort of jig.\\n        “Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”\\n        “Don’t,” Harry advised her.\\n           Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the\\ndarkness.\\n          Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione\\nthe harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They\\nall helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook\\nhands with the others and thanked them very much.\\n        At last, Norbert was going…going…gone.\\n         They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their\\nhands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention\\n— what could spoil their happiness?\\n         The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped\\ninto the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\\n        “Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”\\n        They’d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                       CHAPTER FIFTEEN\\n\\n   THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\n\\n    T hings couldn’t have been worse.\\n        Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor,\\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around\\nHarry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have\\nbeen so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping\\naround the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy\\ntower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the\\ninvisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\n        Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong.\\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\n           “Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you,\\nhe said you had a drag—”\\n             Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she\\ntowered over the three of them.\\n         “I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were\\nup in the astronomy tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”\\n           It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n          “I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy\\nsome cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into\\ntrouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom\\nhere heard the story and believed it, too?”\\n         Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this\\nwasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\\nNeville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the\\ndark, to warn them.\\n\\x0c         “I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out of bed in\\none night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought\\nyou had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to\\nyou than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night,\\nespecially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from\\nGryffindor.”\\n         “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in\\nthe last Quidditch match.\\n             “Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\n         “Professor — please —”\\n         “You can’t —”\\n          “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all\\nof you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”\\n          A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one\\nnight, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt\\nas though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever\\nmake up for this?\\n            Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to\\ncomfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What\\nwould happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?\\n\\n    At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house\\npoints the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started\\nto spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first\\nyears.\\n         From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.\\nEverywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices\\nas they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past\\nthem, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\n        Only Ron stood by him.\\n        “They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\\nof points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”\\n\\x0c          “They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\\nthey?” said Harry miserably.\\n         “Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\n          It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to\\nmeddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with\\nsneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood\\nand offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n         “Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to\\nget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”\\n          But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak\\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him\\n“the Seeker.”\\n         Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time\\nas Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them,\\neither. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her\\nhead down and working in silence.\\n          Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the studying\\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in\\ncomplicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of\\nmagical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\\n            Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he\\nheard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\\nheard Quirrell’s voice.\\n         “No — no — not again, please —”\\n         It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\\n         “All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.\\n          Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until\\nQuirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before\\nhe remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.\\n         All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had\\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\\nwith a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n            Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\x0cAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n         “Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n        “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n         “Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,”\\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So\\nwhat do we do, Harry?”\\n         The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione\\nanswered before Harry could.\\n        “Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\\nanything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n         “But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us\\nup. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween\\nand that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe,\\nhim or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it\\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too\\nfriendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.\\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll\\ntake a lot of explaining.”\\n        Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.\\n        “If we just do a bit of poking around —”\\n        “No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”\\n         He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\\nits moons.\\n\\n   The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\n   Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.\\n   Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\\n\\n   Professor McGonagall\\n\\n    Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points\\nthey’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night\\nof studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved\\nwhat they’d got.\\n        At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\\n\\x0c— and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a\\ndetention, too.\\n        “Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\n         “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you,\\neh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teachers\\nif you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out…hang you\\nby your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my\\noffice, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…Right, off we go, and\\ndon’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”\\n         They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really\\nhorrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.\\n         The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then\\nthey heard a distant shout.\\n        “Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”\\n           Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\nwouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said,\\n“I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,\\nboy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come\\nout in one piece.”\\n          At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\ntracks.\\n          “The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual.\\n“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there —\\nwerewolves, I heard.”\\n        Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.\\n         “That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.\\n“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t\\nyou?”\\n         Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\n         “Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right,\\nHarry, Hermione?”\\n         “I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, they’re\\nhere to be punished, after all.”\\n        “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin lecturin’\\nthem, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from\\nhere.”\\n\\x0c           “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away\\nin the darkness.\\n         Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n         “I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the\\nnote of panic in his voice.\\n         “Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve\\ndone wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”\\n           “But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be\\ncopying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d—”\\n         “—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin’ lines!\\nWhat good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh\\nthink yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’\\npack. Go on.”\\n         Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\\ngaze.\\n           “Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s dangerous\\nwhat we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over\\nhere a moment.”\\n         He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\\n          “Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery\\nstuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re\\ngonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\\n            “And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy,\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n          “There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or\\nFang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter\\ntwo parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the\\nplace, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”\\n         “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\\n          “All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry,\\nan’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if\\nany of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\\nan’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\\nan’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\\n         The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in\\n\\x0cthe earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\\n         They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\\nthe fallen leaves.\\n        Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n        “Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\\n         “Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re\\npowerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\\n          They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\\nblood here and there along the winding path.\\n          “You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve\\ngone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT\\nTREE!”\\n         Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\\na towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\\nready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\\nleaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\\nsquinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\n        “I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”\\n        “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\\n          “That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\\ngrimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”\\n         They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\\nin a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n        “Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”\\n          And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut\\nbody with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.\\n        “Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”\\n        He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\\n          “Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\\nvoice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\\n            “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\n“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\\nGranger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s\\na centaur.\\n        “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.\\n\\x0c           “Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn\\nmuch, up at the school?”\\n        “Erm —”\\n        “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\\n          “A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\\nand stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”\\n         “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter\\nyeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\\n         Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\\nsighed again.\\n         “Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for\\nages past, so it is now.”\\n            “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’\\nunusual?”\\n           “Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\nimpatiently. “Unusually bright.”\\n            “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said\\nHagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”\\n          Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\\nhides many secrets.”\\n        A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\\nthan Ronan.\\n        “Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\\n        “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\\n        “Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in\\nhere lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\\n         Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\\nbright tonight,” he said simply.\\n           “We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\\nanythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”\\n         Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n           “Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\\n        “Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\\n           “Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re\\ngood enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind,\\ncentaurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”\\n\\x0c         “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.\\n         “Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s\\nbin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”\\n             They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\\nHe was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\\npassed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.\\n         “Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”\\n          “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back\\nfor yeh!”\\n            They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\\nlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\n         “You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\\n         “I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault\\nhe’s here in the first place.”\\n          The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s\\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\\ngoing on? Where were the others?\\n            At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\\nsneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\\nsent up the sparks.\\n           “We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were\\nmakin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’\\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\\nwhisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta\\nget this done.”\\n          So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\\nthought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\\nof a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\\nHarry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\\noak.\\n         “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\n         Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\n            It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles\\n\\x0cwhere it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\\n          Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…Then, out\\nof the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\\nstalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\\nreached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and\\nbegan to drink its blood.\\n         “AAAAAAAAAARGH!”\\n          Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded\\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling\\ndown its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t\\nmove for fear.\\n         Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\\nhis scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\\nfigure.\\n         The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\\nor two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\\nover him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\\nand a palomino body.\\n         “Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n         “Yes — thank you — what was that?”\\n           The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\\nout, livid, on Harry’s forehead.\\n          “You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\\nThe forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\\nquicker this way.\\n          “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n         There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\\nand sweaty.\\n         “Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\\nyour back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n          “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n         “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,\\nwe are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\n\\x0cto come in the movements of the planets?”\\n          Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was\\nacting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\n        Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n          “For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\\nstray humans in our forest!”\\n         Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\\ngrab his shoulders to stay on.\\n          “Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\\nset myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\\nalongside me if I must.”\\n         And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\n        Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n         “Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\\nfrom, anyway?”\\n         Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\\nof low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their\\nway through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t\\nwant to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\\npatch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n        “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\\n        “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn\\nand tail hair in Potions.”\\n         “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\\n“Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\\ndeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\\nthe blood touches your lips.”\\n         Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in\\nthe moonlight.\\n         “But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to\\nbe cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n         “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\\nto drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength\\nand power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\x0cknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n           “The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t\\nunderstand who —”\\n        “Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\\nwho has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n        It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.\\nOver the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\\nhim on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\\nDunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n        “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n        “Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n        Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\\nbehind her.\\n            “I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\\nunicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”\\n         “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\\nexamine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n        Harry slid off his back.\\n          “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n         He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\\nshivering behind him.\\n\\n    Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\\nHe shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\\nhim and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n         Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\\nwas still shaking.\\n         “Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the\\nforest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n         “Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\\nVoldemort could hear them.\\n        Harry wasn’t listening.\\n        “Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious…\\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\\nhappen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze\\nshould have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”\\n        “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.\\n\\x0c         “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went\\non feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I\\nsuppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\n        Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n         “Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was\\never afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.\\nAnyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\\nand Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\n         The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed\\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\n        When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded\\nneatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n    Just in case.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                       CHAPTER SIXTEEN\\n\\n   THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\\n\\n    I n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed\\nto get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\\nthrough the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no\\ndoubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\n          It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams,\\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.\\n         They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.\\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points\\nwere given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.\\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to\\nremember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\n          Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.\\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t\\nsleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare,\\nexcept that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure\\ndripping blood in it.\\n         Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\\nor because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and\\nHermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of\\nVoldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and\\nthey were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about\\nwhat Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\n           Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\nquestions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and\\nthey’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came\\nout. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and\\nroll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.\\n         “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they\\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned\\n\\x0cabout the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.”\\n          Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but\\nRon said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped\\nunder a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a\\ngiant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron\\nsighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful,\\nHarry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no\\nneed to worry yet.”\\n         Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n          “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps\\nhurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n         “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n           “I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\ncoming….”\\n         Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n         “Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s\\naround. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past\\nFluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a\\nhurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets\\nDumbledore down.”\\n          Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was\\nsomething he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain\\nthis, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was\\nhalfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that\\none.”\\n         Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with\\nwork, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue\\nsky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him\\nletters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone\\nhow to get past Fluffy…never…but….\\n         Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n         “Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n            “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white.\\n“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n         “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n          “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\\nslope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many\\npeople wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\\n\\x0cfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\\n          “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\\ngrounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.\\n           Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n         “Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?”\\n         “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n         “No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know\\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with\\nlook like?”\\n         “Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\\n         He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\n          “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head —\\nthat’s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I\\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.”\\n           Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him\\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”\\n            “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\\n“Yeah…he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here…He asked a\\nbit about the sorta creatures I took after…so I told him…an’ I said what I’d\\nalways really wanted was a dragon…an’ then…I can’ remember too well, ‘cause\\nhe kept buyin’ me drinks…Let’s see…yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg\\nan’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted…but he had ter be sure I could handle\\nit, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home….So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon\\nwould be easy.…”\\n         “And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to\\nkeep his voice calm.\\n         “Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around\\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him\\ndown, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —”\\n         Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n           “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey —\\nwhere’re yeh goin’?”\\n           Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they\\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the\\ngrounds.\\n         “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger\\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak —\\nit must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\\n\\x0cbelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s\\nDumbledore’s office?”\\n          They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\\ndirection. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\\nanyone who had been sent to see him.\\n          “We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the\\nhall.\\n         “What are you three doing inside?”\\n         It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n           “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely,\\nHarry and Ron thought.\\n          “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\\n         Harry swallowed — now what?\\n            “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because\\nProfessor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.\\n              “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He\\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\\nonce.”\\n         “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\\n             “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\\ndemands on his time – ”\\n         “But this is important.”\\n             “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\\nMagic, Potter?”\\n            “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s\\nabout the Sorcerer’s Stone —”\\n          Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books\\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\\n         “How do you know —?” she spluttered.\\n           “Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to try\\nand steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”\\n         She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n           “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don’t\\nknow how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly\\nsteal it, it’s too well protected.”\\n         “But Professor —”\\n          “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down\\nand gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the\\n\\x0csunshine.”\\n        But they didn’t.\\n         “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\\nout of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out\\neverything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\\nnote, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\\nup.”\\n        “But what can we —”\\n        Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\n        Snape was standing there.\\n        “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\\n        They stared at him.\\n        “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted\\nsmile.\\n        “We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\n         “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this,\\npeople will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to\\nlose any more points, can it?”\\n        Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\n            “Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will\\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”\\n        He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\n        Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n        “Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us\\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if\\nhe leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”\\n        “Why me?”\\n         “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\\nFlitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so\\nworried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\\n         “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\\nSnape.\\n         “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron.\\n“Come on.”\\n          But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the\\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\\nturned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n             “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of\\nenchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come\\n\\x0canywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\\nWeasley, from my own house!”\\n        Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At\\nleast Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open\\nand Hermione came in.\\n          “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I\\nwas doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\\nI’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\\n        “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.\\n        The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\n         “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone\\nfirst.”\\n        “You’re mad!” said Ron.\\n          “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have\\nsaid? You’ll be expelled!”\\n         “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold\\nof the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like\\nwhen he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled\\nfrom! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\\ndoesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your\\nfamilies alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\\nto the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to\\nfind me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never\\ngoing over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\\nyou two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\\n        He glared at them.\\n        “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\\n        “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”\\n        “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\\n        “All — all three of us?”\\n        “Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”\\n        “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to\\nthe Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there might be\\nsomething useful….”\\n        “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\\n         “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret\\nthat I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me\\nout after that.”\\n\\x0c     After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\\nany more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione\\nwas skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much.\\nBoth of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\n         Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n             “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\\nthe cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\\nHe pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.\\n         He ran back down to the common room.\\n         “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\\n– if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”\\n         “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\\nappeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\\nthough he’d been making another bid for freedom.\\n            “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\\nbehind his back.\\n         Neville stared at their guilty faces.\\n         “You’re going out again,” he said.\\n          “No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed,\\nNeville?”\\n          Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford\\nto waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\\n         “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will\\nbe in even more trouble.”\\n         “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”\\n         But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\\n          I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait\\nhole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”\\n         “Neville, “Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot\\n—”\\n          “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should be\\nbreaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\\npeople!”\\n         “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know\\nwhat you’re doing.”\\n          He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\\n\\x0cout of sight.\\n        “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!”\\n        Harry turned to Hermione.\\n        “Do something,” he said desperately.\\n        Hermione stepped forward.\\n        “Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”\\n        She raised her wand.\\n        “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\n          Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\\nbody rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\\nboard.\\n          Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so\\nhe couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\\n        “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.\\n         “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so\\nsorry.”\\n        “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\\n         “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and\\npulled on the invisibility cloak.\\n          But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very\\ngood omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every\\ndistant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\\nof the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\\n           “Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but\\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned\\nher lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.\\n          They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\\nthird floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\\nwould trip.\\n            “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\\nnarrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you.\\nAre you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\\n        He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\n        “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”\\n        Harry had a sudden idea.\\n          “Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own\\nreasons for being invisible.”\\n         Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\\nhovered about a foot off the stairs.\\n\\x0c             “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My\\nmistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible —\\nforgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”\\n            “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this\\nplace tonight.”\\n          “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\\n“Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\\n         And he scooted off.\\n         “Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\\n          A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor —\\nand the door was already ajar.\\n             “Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past\\nFluffy.”\\n         Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\\nwhat was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n          “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the\\ncloak, I won’t need it now.”\\n         “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\\n         “We’re coming,” said Hermione.\\n         Harry pushed the door open.\\n         As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\\ndog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.\\n         “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\\n         “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\\n         “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\\ngoes ….”\\n           He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but\\nfrom the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\\nSlowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\\nthen it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n          “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\\ncrept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they\\napproached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said\\nRon, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\\n         “No, I don’t!”\\n           “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s\\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\\n         “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\\n           “Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just\\n\\x0chave to drop.”\\n          Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\\nand pointed at himself.\\n         “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep\\nthis thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\\n         Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled\\nand twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\\nsleep.\\n          Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\\nno sign of the bottom.\\n           He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t\\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”\\n         “Right,” said Ron.\\n         “See you in a minute, I hope …”\\n         And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\\ndown and —\\n          FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\\nsoft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\\nhe was sitting on some sort of plant.\\n          “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\\nwas the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”\\n         Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\n         “What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\\n          “Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall.\\nCome on, Hermione!”\\n           The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.\\n         “We must be miles under the school,” she said.\\n         “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\\n         “Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\\n           She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\\ntendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\\nbound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\\n         Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\\nbut the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\\naround them.\\n\\x0c           “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s\\nDevil’s Snare!”\\n          “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled\\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut\\nup, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.\\n          “Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\\ncurled around his chest.\\n         “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare…what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes\\nthe dark and the damp.”\\n        “So light a fire!” Harry choked.\\n        “Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her\\nhands.\\n         “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR\\nNOT?”\\n           “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\\nSnape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\\nas it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\\nunraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\\n           “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n          “Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis —\\n‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n          “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was\\nthe only way forward.\\n        All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water\\ntrickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was\\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the\\ndragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a\\nfully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n        “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\n         Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\\nahead.\\n        “Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n        “I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n        “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\n             They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\\nbrilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite\\n\\x0cside of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n        “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\\n          “Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if\\nthey all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”\\n           He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any\\nsecond, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\\nhandle, but it was locked.\\n         The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\\nwouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\\n        “Now what?” said Ron.\\n        “These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.\\n        They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?\\n          “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys\\n— look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around the chamber while the\\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. “…yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve\\ngot to catch the key to the door!”\\n        “But there are hundreds of them!”\\n        Ron examined the lock on the door.\\n         “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the\\nhandle.”\\n          They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\\nkeys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\\n         Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving\\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\\nhad a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\\nkeyhole.\\n         “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no, there\\n— with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.”\\n         Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n        “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\\nwith the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay\\nbelow and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”\\n         Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\\nHarry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and\\n\\x0cHermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\n         They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\\nhand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock\\nhad clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\\nbeen caught twice.\\n         “Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\\n         The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as\\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\\nsight.\\n         They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\\nblack stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\\nRon and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no\\nfaces.\\n        “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\\n         “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the\\nroom.”\\n        Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n        “How?” said Hermione nervously.\\n        “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”\\n        He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s\\nhorse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\\nknight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n           “Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight\\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n         “This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the\\nplace of three of the black pieces….”\\n         Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\\n“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\\n—”\\n        “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”\\n         “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\\nto him instead of that castle.”\\n        “What about you?”\\n        “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\\n         The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\\noff the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\\n\\x0c          “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board.\\n“Yes…look…”\\n        A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\n         Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\\nsent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\n        “Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\\n         Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\\nquite still, facedown.\\n         “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\\n         Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\\nRon only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\\nhimself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\\nlost black ones.\\n           “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\\nthink…”\\n        The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n        “Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\\n        “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n           “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I\\ntake one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate\\nthe king, Harry!”\\n        “But —”\\n        “Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\\n        “Ron —”\\n        “Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\\n        There was no alternative.\\n          “Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now,\\ndon’t hang around once you’ve won.”\\n         He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione\\nscreamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\\nHe looked as if he’d been knocked out.\\n        Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n         The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had\\nwon. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\\nlast desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\n\\x0cand up the next passageway.\\n        “What if he’s —?”\\n         “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you\\nreckon’s next?”\\n          “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put\\ncharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\\nthat leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\n        They had reached another door.\\n        “All right?” Harry whispered.\\n        “Go on.”\\n        Harry pushed it open.\\n          A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\\nrobes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\\nthem, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\\nlump on its head.\\n          “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they\\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\n         He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\\ncame next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\\n        “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\n        They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\\nthem in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n         “Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\\nlooked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\n   Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\n   Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\\n   One among us seven will let you move ahead,\\n   Another will transport the drinker back instead,\\n   Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\\n   Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\\n   Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\\n   To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\\n   First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\n   You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;\\n   Second, different are those who stand at either end,\\n   But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\n\\x0c   Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\\n   Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\n   Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\\n   Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\n\\n    Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\\nthe very last thing he felt like doing.\\n         “Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A\\nlot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here\\nforever.”\\n         “But so will we, won’t we?”\\n           “Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\\npaper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\\nthrough the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\\n         “But how do we know which to drink?”\\n         “Give me a minute.”\\n          Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\\nthe line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\\nher hands.\\n         “Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\\n    fire — toward the Stone.”\\n         Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n          “There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\\nswallow.”\\n         They looked at each other.\\n         “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\\n         Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n          “You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\\nbrooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past\\nFluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\\nhim. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,\\nreally.”\\n         “But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”\\n         “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I\\nmight get lucky again.”\\n         Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\\narms around him.\\n         “Hermione!”\\n         “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”\\n\\x0c        “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\\nhim.\\n             “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\\nimportant things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”\\n        “You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”\\n        “Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\\nthe end, and shuddered.\\n        “It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\\n        “No — but it’s like ice.”\\n        “Quick, go, before it wears off.”\\n        “Good luck — take care.”\\n        “GO!”\\n        Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\n        Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\\nface the black flames.\\n        “Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\n          It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his\\nbody, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\\n— then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\\n         There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t even\\nVoldemort.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                     CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\n\\n   THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\\n\\n    I t was Quirrell.\\n         “You!” gasped Harry.\\n         Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.\\n           “Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here,\\nPotter.”\\n         “But I thought — Snape —”\\n           “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble,\\neither, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So\\nuseful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\\nwould suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”\\n         Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.\\n         “But Snape tried to kill me!”\\n           “No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you off\\nthat broom. I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a\\ncountercurse, trying to save you.”\\n         “Snape was trying to save me?”\\n            “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to\\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny,\\nreally…he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore\\nwatching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\\nfrom winning, he did make himself unpopular…and what a waste of time, when\\nafter all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”\\n          Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\\nthemselves tightly around Harry.\\n             “You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was\\nguarding the Stone.”\\n         “You let the troll in?”\\n         “Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I\\ndid to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\\n\\x0cwas running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\\nstraight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat\\nyou to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off\\nproperly.\\n        “Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”\\n        It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\\nwas the Mirror of Erised.\\n        “This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping\\nhis way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\\nthis…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\\n         All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.\\n        “I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.\\n         “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\\n“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected\\nme all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord\\nVoldemort on my side….”\\n        Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\\n        “I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\\n         Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He\\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n        “But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\\n        “Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\\nwith your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\\nwanted you dead.”\\n           “But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was\\nthreatening you.…”\\n        For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\\n         “Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions\\n— he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\\n        “You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\\n         “He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\\ntraveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\\nideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\\nis no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since\\nthen, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\\nhas had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\\ndispleased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\\n\\x0cme.…”\\n          Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\\nAlley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very\\nday, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n         Quirrell cursed under his breath.\\n         “I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”\\n         Harry’s mind was racing.\\n            What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\\nshould see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how\\ncan I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\\n          He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\\nnoticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\\nQuirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n         “What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\\n          And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\\nfrom Quirrell himself.\\n         “Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\\n         Quirrell rounded on Harry.\\n         “Yes — Potter — come here.”\\n          He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\\ngot slowly to his feet.\\n           “Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what\\nyou see.”\\n         Harry walked toward him.\\n          I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\\nthat’s all.\\n         Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\\nseemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of\\nthe mirror, and opened them again.\\n            He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\\nblood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did\\nso, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly\\n— he’d gotten the Stone.\\n         “Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\\n         Harry screwed up his courage.\\n          “I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I — I’ve\\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.”\\n\\x0c        Quirrell cursed again.\\n            “Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\\nSorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\n            But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\\nQuirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\\n        “He lies…He lies.…”\\n         “Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did\\nyou just see?”\\n        The high voice spoke again.\\n        “Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\\n        “Master, you are not strong enough!”\\n        “I have strength enough…for this…”\\n          Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t\\nmove a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\\nunwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head\\nlooked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\n         Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there\\nshould have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible\\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\\nnostrils, like a snake.\\n        “Harry Potter…” it whispered.\\n        Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\\n          “See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I\\nhave form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been\\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has\\nstrengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me\\nin the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body\\nof my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”\\n           So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He\\nstumbled backward.\\n          “Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join\\nme…or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging me for\\nmercy…”\\n        “LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.\\n         Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\\nhim. The evil face was now smiling.\\n          “How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery….Yes, boy, your\\nparents were brave…I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous\\nfight…but your mother needn’t have died…she was trying to protect you…Now\\n\\x0cgive me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”\\n         “NEVER!”\\n          Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE\\nHIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At\\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it\\nwas about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked\\naround wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\\nlooking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.\\n            “Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\\nlunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\\naround Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\\ncould see Quirrell howling in agony.\\n         “Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”\\n          And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they\\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n         “Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.\\n         Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\\nreached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —\\n         “AAAARGH!”\\n           Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\\nQuirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his\\nonly chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\\nfrom doing a curse.\\n         Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\\nas he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in\\nHarry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s\\nterrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other\\nvoices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\\n          He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\\nfell into blackness, down…down… down….\\n\\n    Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\\nbut his arms were too heavy.\\n          He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\\nstrange.\\n          He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\\nview above him.\\n\\x0c        “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\n            Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was\\nQuirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\\n             “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said\\nDumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\\n        “Then who does? Sir, I —”\\n        “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\\n         Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\\nhospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\\nwas a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n          “Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\\n“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\\nMisters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\\nseat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\\nit might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\\n        “How long have I been in here?”\\n            “Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\\nrelieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”\\n        “But sir, the Stone —”\\n            “I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\\nalthough you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\\n        “You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\\n         “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\\nit became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\\narrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”\\n        “It was you.”\\n        “I feared I might be too late.”\\n        “You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\\n        “Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\\nterrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\\ndestroyed.”\\n        “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —”\\n             “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite\\ndelighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\\nhad a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\\n        “But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”\\n        “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\\n\\x0cthey will die.”\\n        Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\\n        “To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\\nPerenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\\nwell-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\\nwas really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\\nwant! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble\\nis, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\\nthem.”\\n         Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\\nat the ceiling.\\n         “Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone,\\nVol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\\n        “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\\n        “Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t\\nhe? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\\n         “No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\nfor another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\\nQuirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\\nNevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\\nwill merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\\nbattle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\\nreturn to power.”\\n         Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\\nhe said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me…\\nthings I want to know the truth about.…”\\n         “The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\\nshould therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your\\nquestions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll\\nforgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\\n         “Well…Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first\\nplace?”\\n        Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n         “Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now.\\nYou will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are\\nolder…I know you hate to hear this…when you are ready, you will know.”\\n        And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n\\x0c        “But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”\\n         “Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s\\nfor you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign…to have been loved so\\ndeeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\\nprotection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\\nambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It\\nwas agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”\\n        Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice\\nagain, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to\\nme?”\\n        “Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\nyou might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things…your father\\nused it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”\\n        “And there’s something else…”\\n        “Fire away.”\\n        “Quirrell said Snape —”\\n        “Professor Snape, Harry.”\\n        “Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\\ntrue?”\\n          “Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”\\n        “What?”\\n        “He saved his life.”\\n        “What?”\\n          “Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds\\nwork, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt…I do\\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would\\nmake him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s\\nmemory in peace.…”\\n        Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\\n        “And sir, there’s one more thing…”\\n        “Just the one?”\\n        “How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\\n         “Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\\nideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see, only one who\\nwanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it,\\notherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\\n\\x0cbrain surprises even me sometimes…Now, enough questions. I suggest you\\nmake a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was\\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since\\nthen I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with\\na nice toffee, don’t you?”\\n         He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\\nchoked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”\\n\\n    Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n       “Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\\n       “Absolutely not.”\\n       “You let Professor Dumbledore in….”\\n       “Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\\n          “I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\nPomfrey…”\\n       “Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”\\n       And she let Ron and Hermione in.\\n       “Harry!”\\n         Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry\\nwas glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n          “Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\nworried —”\\n             “The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\nhappened?”\\n          It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell;\\nthe mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good\\naudience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was\\nunder Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n       “So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n         “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n        “I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed\\nat how crazy his hero was.\\n       “So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n        “Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that\\ntook a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore\\nwhen we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said,\\n‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”\\n\\x0c           “D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your\\nfather’s cloak and everything?”\\n        “Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s terrible —\\nyou could have been killed.”\\n        “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I\\nthink he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less\\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we\\nwere going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I\\ndon’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s\\nalmost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could….”\\n        “Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen,\\nyou’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\\nSlytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were\\nsteamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”\\n        At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n        “You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.\\n\\n     After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n         I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his\\nmany candy boxes. I can, can’t I?”\\n            “Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said\\nstiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky\\nfeasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”\\n         “Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”\\n            Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took\\none look at him, and burst into tears.\\n          “It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands. I\\ntold the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he\\ndidn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I’ll never\\ndrink again! I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”\\n            “Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out\\nsomehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you\\nhadn’t told him.”\\n         “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”\\n             “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he\\nstopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog,\\n\\x0cI’ve got loads.…”\\n         Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds\\nme. I’ve got yeh a present.”\\n        “It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid\\ngave a weak chuckle.\\n         “Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‘course, he\\nshoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this.…”\\n           It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from\\nevery page were his mother and father.\\n        “Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos…\\nknew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”\\n        Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\n\\n    Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had\\nbeen held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one\\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the\\nSlytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the house\\ncup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent\\ncovered the wall behind the High Table.\\n          When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\\nstarted talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up\\nto look at him.\\n        Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n         “Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble\\nyou with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\\ndelicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little\\nfuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and\\nempty before next year starts.…\\n          “Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\\npoints stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve\\npoints; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has\\nfour hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”\\n          A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\nsight.\\n          “Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent\\nevents must be taken into account.”\\n\\x0c          The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.\\n           “Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\\nLet me see. Yes…\\n          “First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”\\n          Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\\n          “…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\\naward Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n          Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead\\nseemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother,\\nyou know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!”\\n          At last there was silence again.\\n           “Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in the\\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n           Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —\\nthey were a hundred points up.\\n             “Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went\\ndeadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\\nhouse sixty points.”\\n              The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\\nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\\npoints — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if\\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\n          Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n           “There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to\\nour friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”\\n           Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the\\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as\\nNeville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,\\nnudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more\\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n          “Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need\\na little change of decoration.”\\n           He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\n\\x0cGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand,\\nwith a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that\\nSnape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It\\nseemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever\\nwas at Hogwarts.\\n         It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch,\\nor Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget\\ntonight.\\n\\n    Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come\\nthey did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped\\nthrough, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They\\nhad hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be\\nthrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t\\nhave everything in life.\\n           And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\\nNeville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out\\nto all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope\\nthey’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to\\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were\\nboarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became\\ngreener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past\\nMuggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station.\\n          It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old\\nguard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and\\nthrees so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once\\nand alarming the Muggles.\\n          “You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll\\nsend you an owl.”\\n          “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People\\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\\nworld. Some of them called:\\n         “Bye, Harry!”\\n         “See you, Potter!”\\n         “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.\\n         “Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.\\n          He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. “There he\\n\\x0cis, Mom, there he is, look!”\\n         It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at\\nRon.\\n        “Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —”\\n         “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”\\n        Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n        “Busy year?” she said.\\n            “Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\nWeasley.”\\n        “Oh, it was nothing, dear.”\\n        “Ready, are you?”\\n          It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of\\nordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at\\nthe very sight of Harry.\\n        “You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n           “In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we\\nhaven’t got all day.” He walked away.\\n        Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n        “See you over the summer, then.”\\n           “Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\\n          “Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\nspreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at\\nhome. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.…\\n\\x0c\""

r and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery hed for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying the potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinkingno he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imagination as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes shoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife mrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potters mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owlsshooting starsand there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley well i just thoughtmaybeit was something to do withyou knowher crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly whats his name again howard isnt it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree he didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still there it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something was he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it didif it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear it the dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kindhe couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect them how very wrong he was mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it was me she asked my dear professor ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes ive celebrating all right she said impatiently youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owlsshooting starswell theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much sense you cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this youknowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknow who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name i know you havent said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never have only because youre too well noble to use them its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what theyre saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily and jamesi cant believe iti didnt want to believe itoh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i knowi know he said heavily professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not all theyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gone dumbledore nodded glumly its its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killedhe couldnt kill a little boy its just astoundingof all the things to stop himbut how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left now you dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four dumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets harry potter come and live here its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember can you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrids bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever couldnt you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house could i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the muggles sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudleyhe couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the vanishing glass n early ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before his aunt was back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questions dont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his face fell thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mummy and daddy all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirtythirty thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested dont be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slug what about whatshername your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computer aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled i wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listening i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that cars new hes not sitting in it alone dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him idontwanthimttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always spspoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms just then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmas im not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punished on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in midjump but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcycles roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered i know they dont said harry it was only a dream but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond harry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  letters from no one t he escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funny they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasnt as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later life as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water whats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet dont be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stamp turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon thats mine said harry trying to snatch it back whod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge pppetunia he gasped dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly i want to read it said harry furiously as its mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope harry didnt move i want my letter he shouted let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats bestwe wont do anything but im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboard wheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to me no one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful er yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinkingyoure really getting a bit big for itwe think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom why said harry dont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in therei need that roommake him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap harry could see three letters addressed in green ink i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give up im not sure thatll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises on saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shake em offshake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room wouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dudley sniveled its monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks still you werent eleven every day uncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out it was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown house the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully he was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now five minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow three minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty secondstwentyten nine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him threetwoone boom the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come in hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the keeper of the keys b oom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidly there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them whos there he shouted i warn you im armed there was a pause then smash the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them all couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yer dad but yehve got yer moms eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sir he said you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled true i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows its them as should be sorry i knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against the wall do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to school after all and his marks werent bad i know some things he said i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode dursley he boomed uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said i mean theyre famous youre famous what my my mom and dad werent famous were they yeh don knowyeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare yeh don know what yeh are he said finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop he commanded stop right there sir i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an youve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid harry yer a wizard there was silence inside the hut only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard im a what gasped harry a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un id say once yehve been trained up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be an i reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hutontherock the sea he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sorc chf warlock supreme mugwump international confed of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment term begins on september we await your owl by no later than july yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt decide which to ask first after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his things tomorrow weathers horrible hope youre well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashenfaced but looking very angry moved into the firelight hes not going he said hagrid grunted id like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said a what said harry interested a muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like them an its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry you knew im a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of course we knew how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew youd be just the same just as strange just as as abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white as soon as he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgently the anger faded from hagrids face he looked suddenly anxious i never expected this he said in a low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didnt know ah harry i don know if im the right person ter tell yeh but someones gotta yeh cant go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys well its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i cant tell yeh everythin its a great mystry parts of it he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but its incredible yeh dont know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there was this wizard who went bad as bad as you could go worse worse than worse his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out could you write it down harry suggested nah cant spell it all right voldemort hagrid shuddered don make me say it again anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right dark days harry didnt know who ter trust didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witchesterrible things happened he was takin over course some stood up to him an he killed em horribly one o the only safe places left was hogwarts reckon dumbledores the only one youknowwho was afraid of didnt dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mystry is why you knowwho never tried to get em on his side beforeprobably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade emmaybe he just wanted em outta the way all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago you was just a year old he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he said but its that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find anyway youknowwho killed em an then an this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldnt do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that was no ordinary cut thats what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it didnt work on you an thats why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid was watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdoes no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent thats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them but what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwho good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry seehe was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin back most of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers too weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harry there was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled not a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire now he came to think about itevery odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angrychased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reachdreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow backand the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fight havent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potters son goin ter hogwarts yer mad his names been down ever since he was born hes off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world seven years there and he wont know himself hell be with youngsters of his own sort fer a change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle vernon but he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard shouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows be grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why arent you supposed to do magic asked harry oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth in me third year they snapped me wand in half an everything but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper great man dumbledore why were you expelled its gettin late and weve got lots ter do tomorrow said hagrid loudly gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry you can kip under that he said don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o doormice in one o the pockets hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  diagon alley h arry woke early the next morning although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight it was a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards when i open my eyes ill be at home in my cupboard there was suddenly a loud tapping noise and theres aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking but he still didnt open his eyes it had been such a good dream tap tap tap all right harry mumbled im getting up he sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coat dont do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pockets hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture um hagrid mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots i havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last nighthe wont pay for me to go and learn magic dont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer parents didnt leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah first stop fer us is gringotts wizards bank have a sausage theyre not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one gringotts run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding goblins yeah so yehd be mad ter try an rob it ill tell yeh that never mess with goblins harry gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see got everythin come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat flew said hagrid flew yeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke they say theres dragons guardin the high security vaults and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his life ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page theres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister o course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the country why why blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragon youd like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets people stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket good said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school o f witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar one winter cloak black silver fastenings please note that all pupils clothes should carry name tags course books all students should have a

are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud if yeh know where to go said hagrid harry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow i dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous place it was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potterwhat an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid was beaming then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at last so proud mr potter im just so proud always wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutter delighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggle ive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts pppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand c cant ttell you how ppleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell ddefense against the dddark arts muttered professor quirrell as though hed rather not think about it nnot that you nneed it eh pppotter he laughed nervously youll be ggetting all your equipment i suppose ive ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires mmyself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others wouldnt let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble must get on lots ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experiencethey say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrella vampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can three uptwo across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphook griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall whats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in thats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnt he works at hogwarts oh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt he hes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every second yes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think hes brilliant said harry coldly do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parents theyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent they they were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean i really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families whats your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts whats up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch dont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkins and he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch its our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherin youknowwho was one vol sorry youknowwho was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid they bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tonguetying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian i was trying to find out how to curse dudley im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoop outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red you dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand a magic wandthis was what harry had been really looking forward to the last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inches pliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes and thats where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white finger im sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteen andahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong handswell if id known what that wand was going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you againoak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it it was sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well im righthanded said harry hold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well wellhow curioushow very curious he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curiouscurious sorry said harry but whats curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteenandahalf inches yew curious indeed how these things happen the wand chooses the wizard rememberi think we must expect great things from you mr potterafter all hewhomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words everyone thinks im special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivanderbut i dont know anything about magic at all how can they expect great things im famous and i cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile don you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find mesee yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the journey from platform nine and threequarters h arrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at all half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while harry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first on the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening er i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didnt say anything where is this school anyway i dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket i just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he read his aunt and uncle stared platform what nine and threequarters dont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequarters its on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll see you just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off they reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face well there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someone he stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panic according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and ten at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying packed with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owl heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying now whats the platform number said the boys mother nine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished fred you next the plump woman said im not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cant you tell im george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere there was nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose yes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before ron er okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt comehe kept on runninghe opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done it smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot want a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrier yes please harry panted oy fred cmere and help with the twins help harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes whats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harrys lightning scar blimey said the other twin are you he is said the first twin arent you he added to harry what said harry harry potter chorused the twins oh him said harry i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red then to his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door fred george are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying their mother had just taken out her handkerchief ron youve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose mom geroff he wriggled free aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins shut up said ron wheres percy said their mother hes coming now the oldest boy came striding into sight he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on it cant stay long mother he said im up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise you should have said something we had no idea hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins because hes a prefect said their mother fondly all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left then she turned to the twins now you two this year you behave yourselves if i get one more owl telling me youve youve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet weve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom its not funny and look after ron dont worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it hey mom guess what guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking you know that blackhaired boy who was near us in the station know who he is who harry potter harry heard the little girls voice oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom eh please youve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isnt something you goggle at in a zoo is he really fred how do you know asked him saw his scar its really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what youknowwho looks like their mother suddenly became very stern i forbid you to ask him fred no dont you dare as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and their younger sister began to cry dont ginny well send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat george only joking mom the train began to move harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose hey ron the twins were back listen were going down the middle of the train lee jordans got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves fred and george weasley and this is ron our brother see you later then bye said harry and ron the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them are you really harry potter ron blurted out harry nodded oh well i thought it might be one of fred and georges jokes said ron and have you really got you know he pointed at harrys forehead harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar ron stared so thats where youknowwho yes said harry but i cant remember it nothing said ron eagerly well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him er yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know loads of magic already the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about i heard you went to live with muggles said ron what are they like horrible well not all of them my aunt and uncle and cousin are though wish id had three wizard brothers five said ron for some reason he was looking gloomy im the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts you could say ive got a lot to live up to bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch now percys a prefect fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre really funny everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do its no big deal because they did it first you never get anything new either with five brothers ive got bills old robes charlies old wand and percys old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep his names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers instead rons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the window harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron up and until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped what said harry you said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learni bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the class you wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridor he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat hungry are you starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs theyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him no said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore halfmoon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore so this is dumbledore said harry dont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts c onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappeared hes gone well you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of herdo you want it you can start collecting rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped help yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beans you want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner bleaaargh see sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepper the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearful sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry yes said the boy miserably well if you see him he left dont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talk the rat was still snoozing on rons lap he might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end unicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again the toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes has anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth weve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand oh are you doing magic lets see it then she sat down ron looked taken aback er all right he cleared his throat sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep are you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart either im ron weasley ron muttered harry potter said harry are you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed goodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too badanyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her whatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin thats the house vol i mean youknowwho was in yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressed you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school charlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared really what happened to them nothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind it harry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time youknowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying whats your quidditch team ron asked er i dont know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alley is it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is it yes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger draco malfoy looked at him think my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take it i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up say that again ron said his face as red as his hair oh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron but we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleep and so he had youve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley ive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with something youd better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing down he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor the train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads cmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice yehll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the sorting hat t he door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left the chamber harry swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron some sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed what the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years nobody answered new students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavens harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the house maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all theres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again so weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannah a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hat the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him finchfletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor granger hermione her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself there werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waited hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interestingso where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban and now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there welcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or not is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harry harrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat it was all delicious that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive introduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wanted like this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families im halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was allmuggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin it happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped a hand to his head what is it asked percy nnothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at all whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him again at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silent ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give you first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did hes not serious he muttered to percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating crosslegged in the air clutching the walking sticks oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again the bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed great food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the potions master t here look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes there were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk the ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight professor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first class transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head start friday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge double potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far at the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated him potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmth they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the sensesi can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the air i dont know sir said harry snapes lips curled into a sneer tut tut fame clearly isnt everything he ignored hermiones hand lets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter i dont know sir thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling i dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winked snape however was not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville you potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron dont push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang back hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open hang on he said back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robes harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day but were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the date hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the midnight duel h arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke its a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him at threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom no shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into trouble harry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunned give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clapping no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet trembling never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicks class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys potter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a natural ive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly woods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven id say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we cant bend the first year rule heaven knows we need a better team than last year flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape in the face for weeks professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry i want to hear youre training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about it seeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry i start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over well done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beaters i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the school bet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle having a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my second well a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it was hermione granger cant a person eat in peace in this place said ron hermione ignored him and spoke to harry i couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be its really very selfish of you and its really none of your business said harry goodbye said ron all the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block them there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss it halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harry a lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown you said ron furiously go back to bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to this harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole hermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower now what am i going to do she asked shrilly thats your problem said ron weve got to go were going to be late they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them im coming with you she said you are not dyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up youve got some nerve said ron loudly shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard something it was a sort of snuffling mrs norris breathed ron squinting through the dark it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer thank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewhere hows your arm said harry fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville if either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room i think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you weve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her that lets go it wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them it was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight shut up peeves please youll get us thrown out peeves cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty not if you dont give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shouts oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening which way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell me say please dont mess with me peeves now where did they go shant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice all right please nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage he thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far they werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbidden they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three heads three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filch they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs it was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding somethingwhat had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  halloween m alfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog again hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist it its not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boys he squeaked potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is it a nimbus two thousand it is said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he added harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i wouldnt be on the team so i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand i thought you werent speaking to us said harry yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to him very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meantyou really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate inside were four differentsized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each side three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt it whats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quickly now theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat im going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box stand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgers at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it any questions harry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem we wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggar dium leviosa make the gar nice and long you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosa their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermione harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint there was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element follow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought hermione what about her she doesnt know about the troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footsteps hes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight it was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room the keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron its the girls bathroom harry gasped hermione they said together it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran inside hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall the troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went oy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa the club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble harry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it was hermione who spoke first is it dead i dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the trolls trousers a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up they hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down then a small voice came out of the shadows please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermiones good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded him they had reached the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they said and entered the common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  quidditch a s they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway whats that youve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages harry showed him library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape give it to me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes snape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandages blasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matter in a low whisper harry told them what hed seen you know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermiones eyes were wide no he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forget the next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match youve got to eat some breakfast i dont want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione im not hungry harry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green wood cleared his throat for silence okay men he said and women said chaser angelina johnson and women wood agreed this is it the big one said fred weasley the one weve all been waiting for said george we know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right its time good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers madam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall and shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle thats chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yet kept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plan keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitch once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed the gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the game but this isnt soccer dean ron reminded him hagrid however was on deans side they oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like that it happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goalposts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee was still commentating slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a no the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broombut he cant have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something jinxing the broom said hermione what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few wellchosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire a sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened it was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutes harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand ive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermione it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truth i found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding hagrid dropped the teapot how do you know about fluffy he said fluffy yeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly now dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that is but snapes trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione the afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape i know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw him im tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the mirror of erised c hristmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms worst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs weasley ron let go of the front of malfoys robes he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked just one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree the library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermione unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said harry madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him youd better get out then go on out wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off to lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe to ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrys harry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl a second very small parcel contained a note we received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piece thats friendly said harry ron was fascinated by the fifty pence weird he said what a shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these i think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroon thats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped it something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gasped ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into material its an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell it is look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely theres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloak id give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look harrys got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family why arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warm i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head you havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forge whats all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one i dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew and youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for family they frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it his fathersthis had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had said he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole whos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridor where should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked the library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps the restricted section was right at the back of the library stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his ears he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solid he backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in it looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of it he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him but the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror there he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror she was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys did harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back and hurried from the room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirror id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anything harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget it and go back no harry hissed i know its here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor its here just here yes they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror there they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of him see harry whispered i cant see anything look look at them allthere are loads of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ron though was staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you no im alone but im different i look older and im head boy what i am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror shows the future how can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time youre only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parents dont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and left this isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us come on and ron pulled harry out of the room the snow still hadnt melted the next morning want to play chess harry said ron no why dont we go down and visit hagrid noyou go i know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonight why not i dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione im serious harry dont go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyone and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him i i didnt see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didnt know it was called that sir but i expect youve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head let me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that help harry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up sir professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared one can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  nicholas flamel d umbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel was they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again wood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms will you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her dont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron i cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i dont want more trouble he mumbled youve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry youre worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog thanks harryi think ill go to beddyou want the card you collect them dont you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermione ive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself at last she found what she was looking for i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stone this didnt have quite the effect shed expected the what said harry and ron oh honestly dont you two read look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight see said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match im going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show themitll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermione as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped dont nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watch harrys heart did a somersault dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was right there was no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy im worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry im warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet youre in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy ron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirrorbeen keeping busyexcellent snape spat bitterly on the ground harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed harry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followed the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there too harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were saying ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severus oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet bbbut severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him ii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocus im waiting bbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomfrey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin ive waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heard so we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  norbert the norwegian ridgeback q uirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes harry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know its an a what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone

harry hagrid shuffled off what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully do you think it had anything to do with the stone im going to see what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table dragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guide hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry but its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romania but there arent wild dragons in britain said harry of course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forget so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them it was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him o course i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermione well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh thatlets seehe borrowed fluffy from methen some o the teachers did enchantments professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffy youre the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly well thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boiling cant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it too hagrid whats that but he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermione well ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnt hagrid you live in a wooden house she said but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut wonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nuts then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two words its hatching ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of it hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whispered malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at all ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited its nearly out he ushered them inside the egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes it sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snout isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window whats the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking him malfoy had seen the dragon something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free i cant said hagrid hes too little hed die they looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor ive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommy hes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys ear hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip i i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cant harry suddenly turned to ron charlie he said youre losing it too said ron im ron remember no charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragons we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him the following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window its hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note dear ron how are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still dark send me an answer as soon as possible love charlie they looked at one another weve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy there was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonous harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down itll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep its too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them i wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handle when they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg aargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off byebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easier nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flared professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear detention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig malfoys got detention i could sing dont harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness charlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much at last norbert was goinggoinggone they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whispered we are in trouble theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the forbidden forest t hings couldnt have been worse filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already had harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue i think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like them theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yeshard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask meits just a pity they let the old punishments die outhang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever neededright off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid im not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent directions theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs long teeth all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets go the forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away i knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself im armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this is ronan you two hes a centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly a bit well thats something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victims he said so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair fewkeep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaursthey know thingsjus don let on much dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got nevilleits our fault hes here in the first place the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closer it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredthen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet yes thank you what was that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs in anger for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shaking snape wants the stone for voldemortand voldemorts waiting in the forestand all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done sobane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happenthey must show that voldemorts coming backbane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill mei suppose thats written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in case hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  through the trapdoor i n years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think its a warningit means dangers coming ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot harry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffyneverbut harry suddenly jumped to his feet wherere you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something said harry he had turned white weve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up dont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answer hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl hullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off no were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to remember yeahhe asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper herehe asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took afterso i told himan i said what id always really wanted was a dragonan theni can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinkslets seeyeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wantedbut he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old homeso i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy and did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked trying to keep his voice calm well yeah how many threeheaded dogs dyeh meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey wherere yeh goin harry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds weve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of books we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do why harry swallowed now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once hes gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor its about the sorcerers stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protected but professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didnt its tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round snape was standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them back be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone steps harry turned to the others right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do that why me its obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape and wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on but that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glittering im going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelled so what harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them youre right harry said hermione in a small voice ill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron all all three of us oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and took through my books there might be something useful but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back down to the common room wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalus she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered its the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you and he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor and the door was already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goes he put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black theres no way of climbing down well just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under the school she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest devils snare devils snarewhat did professor sprout say it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think its a ghost i dont knowsounds like wings to me theres light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at oncewell theres no other choiceill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was locked the other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birdsthey cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys yes look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do harry whispered its obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you next to him instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board yeslook a white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly its the only wayive got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three spaces to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if hes hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle theres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flyingkey room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry what if youknowwhos with him well i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him hermione harry youre a great wizard you know im not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him me said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be careful you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered its not poison said harry anxiously no but its like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flames here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber there was already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone  the man with two faces i t was quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill me no no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny reallyhe neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopularand what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell it was the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like thisbut hes in londonill be far away by the time he gets back all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stoneim presenting it to my masterbut where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek itsince then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished medecided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understandis the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind was racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myself finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boyuse the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feet come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips he lieshe lies potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to himfacetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enoughfor this harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapori have form only when i can share anothers bodybut there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and mindsunicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeksyou saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forestand once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my ownnowwhy dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join meor youll meet the same end as your parentsthey died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smiling how touching it hissed i always value braveryyes boy your parents were bravei killed your father first and he put up a courageous fightbut your mother neednt have diedshe was trying to protect younow give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness downdown down something gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stone then who does sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the best but that means he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinkingsir even if the stones gone vol i mean youknowwho call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has he no harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to sharenot being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course lie wellvoldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one dayput it from your mind for now harry when you are olderi know you hate to hear thiswhen you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible signto have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful thingsyour father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and theres something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debti do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir theres one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimesnow enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that was the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in harry hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly after a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said stiffly as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears its all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loads hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present its not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have anydyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they wereyou have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts now as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventytwo a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute points to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there was silence again second to miss hermione grangerfor the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points the din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts it was the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trollshe would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and threequarters at kings cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look it was ginny weasley rons younger sister but she wasnt pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and its rude to point mrs weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mrs weasley oh it was nothing dear ready are you it was uncle vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mrs weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we havent got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face they dont know were not allowed to use magic at home im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer'"

              "\"\\n\\n   DIAGON ALLEY\\n\\n    H arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight,\\nhe kept his eyes shut tight.\\n        “It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid\\ncame to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be\\nat home in my cupboard.”\\n        There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\n         And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\\nsinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\n        Tap. Tap. Tap.\\n        “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”\\n          He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa,\\nand there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its\\nbeak.\\n         Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake\\nup. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\\n        “Don’t do that.”\\n           Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n        “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n        “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n        “What?”\\n        “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\n         Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n        “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n        “Knuts?”\\n        “The little bronze ones.”\\n        Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so\\n\\x0cHarry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\\nthrough the open window.\\n         Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n         “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all\\nyer stuff fer school.”\\n         Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him\\nhad got a puncture.\\n         “Um — Hagrid?”\\n         “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n         “I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night…he\\nwon’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\\n          “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\\nhead. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”\\n         “But if their house was destroyed —”\\n          “They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\\nGringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’\\nsay no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\\n         “Wizards have banks?”\\n         “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\\n         Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n         “Goblins?”\\n         “Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess\\nwith goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh\\nwant ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit\\nGringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself\\nup proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you —\\ngettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.”\\n         “Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\\n          Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now\\nand the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still\\nthere, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n         “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\n         “Flew,” said Hagrid.\\n         “Flew?”\\n         “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve\\ngot yeh.”\\n           They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\\nimagine him flying.\\n\\x0c         “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\\nhis sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind\\nnot mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n         “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off\\ntoward land.\\n        “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n          “Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\nspoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh\\ngotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep\\nunder the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did\\nmanage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n          Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left\\nalone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many\\nquestions in his life.\\n        “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning\\nthe page.\\n           “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n           “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’\\ncourse, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.\\nBungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,\\naskin’ fer advice.”\\n        “But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n          “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still\\nwitches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\\n        “Why?”\\n          “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their\\nproblems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\\n          At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\n         Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to\\nthe station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and\\nsaying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n          “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n        “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”\\n\\x0c        “You’d like one?”\\n        “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\\n           They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\nminutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it,\\ngave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n         People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n        “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\\n        Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n        “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\\n           Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night\\nbefore, and read:\\n\\n   HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n   UNIFORM\\n   First-year students will require:\\n   1.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\\nloudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n         “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n         Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\\nyou a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\\nCould there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\\nreally shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\\nhuge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the\\nDursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\\nthough everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t\\nhelp trusting him.\\n          “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a\\nfamous place.”\\n         It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry\\nwouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.\\nTheir eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\\nother as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\\nmost peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\\nmention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\n         For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\\nlong pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\\nquite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\\nat him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\\n         “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great\\n\\x0chand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\\n         “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be\\n—?”\\n         The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n           “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an\\nhonor.”\\n          He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\n         “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\\n           Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\\nwas beaming.\\n           Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n         “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\\n         “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n         “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\\n           “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\\nDiggle.”\\n         “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in\\nhis excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\\n            “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\\n“Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again —\\nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n           A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\\neyes was twitching.\\n          “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\\nof your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n           “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-\\ncan’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\\n         “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n         “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as\\nthough he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\\nHe laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve\\ng-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\\nthe very thought.\\n          But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\\nmake himself heard over the babble.\\n\\x0c         “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\n          Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\\nbut a trash can and a few weeds.\\n         Hagrid grinned at Harry.\\n          “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\\nwas tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n         “Is he always that nervous?”\\n         “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’\\noutta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\\nsay he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with\\na hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\n          Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n         “Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\\n         He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\n           The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\\nsmall hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were\\nfacing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\\nstreet that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n         “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\n           He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\\nHarry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\\nback into solid wall.\\n          The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\\nCauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n         “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\\nfirst.”\\n         Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\\noutside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon\\nliver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\\n          A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\\nOwl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\\nabout Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\\nit. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —\\n\\x0cfastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\\nstrange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\\nbarrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\\nrolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\\n         “Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\n           They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\\nscarlet and gold, was —\\n          “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\\na swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\\nfeet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\n     Enter, stranger, but take heed\\n     Of what awaits the sin of greed,\\n     For those who take, but do not earn,\\n     Must pay most dearly in their turn.\\n     So if you seek beneath our floors\\n     A treasure that was never yours,\\n     Thief, you have been warned, beware\\n     Of finding more than treasure there.\\n\\n    “Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\\n        A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\\nbehind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\\nexamining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\\ncount leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\\nof these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\\n          “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some\\nmoney outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\\n        “You have his key, sir?”\\n           “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\\ngoblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\\ngoblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\\n        “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n        The goblin looked at it closely.\\n        “That seems to be in order.”\\n\\x0c         “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\\nseven hundred and thirteen.”\\n        The goblin read the letter carefully.\\n           “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone\\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\\n         Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\\nthe doors leading off the hall.\\n            “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\\nHarry asked.\\n          “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts\\nbusiness. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\n           Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\\nfloor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\\nthem. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\\n         At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\\nto remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\\nThe rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t\\nsteering.\\n           Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\\ntwisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even\\ndeeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\\nfrom the ceiling and floor.\\n         “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s\\nthe difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n          “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions\\njust now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\\n         He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\\nhis knees from trembling.\\n          Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\\nand as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\\nsilver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n        “All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\n            All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known\\n\\x0cabout this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\\nbeen a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\n         Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n         “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\\nGriphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\\nslowly?”\\n         “One speed only,” said Griphook.\\n          They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\\nunderground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\\nat the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\\nneck.\\n         Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n           “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\\nwith one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n         “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the\\ndoor and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\\n         “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\\n         “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\n          Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\\nat the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\\nlittle package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\\nbetter than to ask.\\n           “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way\\nback, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n    One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\\nHarry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\\nwas holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than\\neven Dudley had ever had.\\n          “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\\nMalkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\\noff fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did\\n\\x0cstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling\\nnervous.\\n         Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n           “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot\\nhere — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\n         In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\\nfootstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\\nstood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\\nto pin it to the right length.\\n         “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n         “Yes,” said Harry.\\n            “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street\\nlooking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m\\ngoing to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t\\nhave their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in\\nsomehow.”\\n         Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n         “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n         “No,” said Harry.\\n         “Play Quidditch at all?”\\n         “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n          “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house,\\nand I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n         “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n          “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll\\nbe in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\\nI’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n             “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\\ninteresting.\\n         “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\\nwindow. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\\nice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n          “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.\\n“He works at Hogwarts.”\\n         “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n          “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\\nevery second.\\n         “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school\\ngrounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up\\n\\x0csetting fire to his bed.”\\n         “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n         “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where\\nare your parents?”\\n          “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into\\nthe matter with this boy.\\n         “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our\\nkind, weren’t they?”\\n         “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n         “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just\\nnot the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\\nhave never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\\nshould keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n          But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done,\\nmy dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\\ndown from the footstool.\\n         “Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n           Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n         “What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n          “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\\nWhen they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”\\n           “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’\\nabout Quidditch!”\\n          “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\\nboy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n         “— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed\\nin —”\\n           “Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s\\ngrown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what\\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what\\ndoes he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with\\nmagic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had\\nfer a sister!”\\n         “So what is Quidditch?”\\n         “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world\\n— everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and\\nthere’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\x0c         “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n            “School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\nduffers, but —”\\n         “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n           “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who\\nwas one.”\\n         “Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\\n         “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\n          They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\\nstones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\\nfull of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\\nDudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on\\nsome of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and\\nCountercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the\\nLatest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More)\\nby Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n         “I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n          “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway,\\nyeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh\\nget ter that level.”\\n           Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says\\npewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion\\ningredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,\\nwhich was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad\\neggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs,\\ndried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of\\nfangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\\nbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry\\nhimself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and\\nminuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n         Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\\n           “Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday\\npresent.”\\n         Harry felt himself go red.\\n         “You don’t have to —”\\n          “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad,\\n\\x0ctoads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats,\\nthey make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead\\nuseful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\n         Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her\\nwing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\nQuirrell.\\n         “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n        A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n         The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a\\nfaded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n        A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library;\\nhe swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For\\nsome reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n          “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\\nspindly chair.\\n          An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\\n        “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n          “Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon.\\nHarry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only\\nyesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter\\ninches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\n          Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.\\nThose silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n           “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\\ninches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say\\nyour father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\n         Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\x0c        “And that’s where…”\\n           Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a\\nlong, white finger.\\n          “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-\\nand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong\\nhands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\\n…”\\n        He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n           “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, sixteen\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\\n        “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\\n          “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you\\ngot expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n          “Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got\\nthe pieces, though,” he added brightly.\\n        “But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n           “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n           “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well,\\nnow — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver\\nmarkings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\\n        “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\\n           “Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.\\nAs he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful\\nmagical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and\\nthe heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no\\ntwo unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”\\n           Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting\\naround the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n         “That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the\\nfloor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring.\\nNine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”\\n         Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n        “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\\n           Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\n\\x0csnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n        “No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\\nGo on, go on, try it out.”\\n         Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he\\nseemed to become.\\n          “Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here\\nsomewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly\\nand phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\\n         Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a\\nstream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing\\ndancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr.\\nOllivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how\\ncurious…how very curious…”\\n          He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\\nstill muttering, “Curious…curious…\\n        “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\n        Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n        “I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It\\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for\\nthis wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\n        Harry swallowed.\\n         “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must expect great\\nthings from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great\\nthings — terrible, yes, but great.”\\n          Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He\\npaid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\\nshop.\\n\\n    The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their\\nway back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he\\ndidn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground,\\nladen as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl\\nasleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington\\n\\x0cstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the\\nshoulder.\\n        “Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\\n         He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\\nthem. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n        “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\n        Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his\\nlife — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\n          “Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander…but I don’t know anything\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t\\neven remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,\\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”\\n         Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\\nwore a very kind smile.\\n         “Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the\\nbeginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard.\\nYeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at\\nHogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”\\n           Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n         “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross\\n— it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with\\nyer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Harry.”\\n        The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he\\nwas out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but\\nhe blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                            \""

            "diagon alley h arry woke early the next morning although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight it was a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards when i open my eyes ill be at home in my cupboard there was suddenly a loud tapping noise and theres aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking but he still didnt open his eyes it had been such a good dream tap tap tap all right harry mumbled im getting up he sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coat dont do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pockets hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture um hagrid mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots i havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last nighthe wont pay for me to go and learn magic dont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer parents didnt leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah first stop fer us is gringotts wizards bank have a sausage theyre not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one gringotts run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding goblins yeah so yehd be mad ter try an rob it ill tell yeh that never mess with goblins harry gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see got everythin come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat flew said hagrid flew yeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke they say theres dragons guardin the high security vaults and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his life ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page theres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister o course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the country why why blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragon youd like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets people stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket good said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school o f witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar one winter cloak black silver fastenings please note that all pupils clothes should carry name tags course books all students should have a copy of each of the following the standard book of spells grade

pewter standard size set of glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales students may also bring an owl or a cat or a toad parents are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud if yeh know where to go said hagrid harry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow i dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous place it was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potterwhat an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid was beaming then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at last so proud mr potter im just so proud always wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutter delighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggle ive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts pppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand c cant ttell you how ppleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell ddefense against the dddark arts muttered professor quirrell as though hed rather not think about it nnot that you nneed it eh pppotter he laughed nervously youll be ggetting all your equipment i suppose ive ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires mmyself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others wouldnt let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble must get on lots ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experiencethey say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrella vampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can three uptwo across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphook griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall whats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in thats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnt he works at hogwarts oh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt he hes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every second yes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think hes brilliant said harry coldly do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parents theyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent they they were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean i really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families whats your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts whats up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch dont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkins and he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch its our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherin youknowwho was one vol sorry youknowwho was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid they bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tonguetying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian i was trying to find out how to curse dudley im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoop outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red you dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand a magic wandthis was what harry had been really looking forward to the last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inches pliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes and thats where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white finger im sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteen andahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong handswell if id known what that wand was going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you againoak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it it was sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well im righthanded said harry hold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well wellhow curioushow very curious he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curiouscurious sorry said harry but whats curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteenandahalf inches yew curious indeed how these things happen the wand chooses the wizard rememberi think we must expect great things from you mr potterafter all hewhomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words everyone thinks im special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivanderbut i dont know anything about magic at all how can they expect great things im famous and i cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile don you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find mesee yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone\n"

              "\"\\n\\n   THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\n\\n    T hings couldn’t have been worse.\\n        Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor,\\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around\\nHarry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have\\nbeen so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping\\naround the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy\\ntower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the\\ninvisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\n        Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong.\\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\n           “Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you,\\nhe said you had a drag—”\\n             Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she\\ntowered over the three of them.\\n         “I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were\\nup in the astronomy tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”\\n           It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n          “I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy\\nsome cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into\\ntrouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom\\nhere heard the story and believed it, too?”\\n         Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this\\nwasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\\nNeville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the\\ndark, to warn them.\\n\\x0c         “I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out of bed in\\none night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought\\nyou had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to\\nyou than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night,\\nespecially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from\\nGryffindor.”\\n         “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in\\nthe last Quidditch match.\\n             “Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\n         “Professor — please —”\\n         “You can’t —”\\n          “Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all\\nof you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”\\n          A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one\\nnight, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt\\nas though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever\\nmake up for this?\\n            Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to\\ncomfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What\\nwould happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?\\n\\n    At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house\\npoints the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started\\nto spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first\\nyears.\\n         From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.\\nEverywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices\\nas they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past\\nthem, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\n        Only Ron stood by him.\\n        “They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\\nof points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”\\n\\x0c          “They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\\nthey?” said Harry miserably.\\n         “Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\n          It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to\\nmeddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with\\nsneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood\\nand offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n         “Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to\\nget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”\\n          But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak\\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him\\n“the Seeker.”\\n         Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time\\nas Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them,\\neither. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her\\nhead down and working in silence.\\n          Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the studying\\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in\\ncomplicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of\\nmagical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\\n            Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he\\nheard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\\nheard Quirrell’s voice.\\n         “No — no — not again, please —”\\n         It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\\n         “All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.\\n          Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until\\nQuirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before\\nhe remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.\\n         All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had\\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\\nwith a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n            Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\x0cAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n         “Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n        “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n         “Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,”\\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So\\nwhat do we do, Harry?”\\n         The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione\\nanswered before Harry could.\\n        “Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\\nanything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n         “But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us\\nup. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween\\nand that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe,\\nhim or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it\\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too\\nfriendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.\\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll\\ntake a lot of explaining.”\\n        Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.\\n        “If we just do a bit of poking around —”\\n        “No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”\\n         He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\\nits moons.\\n\\n   The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\n   Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.\\n   Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\\n\\n   Professor McGonagall\\n\\n    Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points\\nthey’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night\\nof studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved\\nwhat they’d got.\\n        At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\\n\\x0c— and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a\\ndetention, too.\\n        “Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\n         “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you,\\neh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teachers\\nif you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out…hang you\\nby your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my\\noffice, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…Right, off we go, and\\ndon’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”\\n         They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really\\nhorrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.\\n         The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then\\nthey heard a distant shout.\\n        “Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”\\n           Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\nwouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said,\\n“I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,\\nboy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come\\nout in one piece.”\\n          At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\ntracks.\\n          “The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual.\\n“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there —\\nwerewolves, I heard.”\\n        Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.\\n         “That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.\\n“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t\\nyou?”\\n         Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\n         “Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right,\\nHarry, Hermione?”\\n         “I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, they’re\\nhere to be punished, after all.”\\n        “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin lecturin’\\nthem, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from\\nhere.”\\n\\x0c           “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away\\nin the darkness.\\n         Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n         “I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the\\nnote of panic in his voice.\\n         “Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve\\ndone wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”\\n           “But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be\\ncopying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d—”\\n         “—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin’ lines!\\nWhat good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh\\nthink yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’\\npack. Go on.”\\n         Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\\ngaze.\\n           “Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s dangerous\\nwhat we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over\\nhere a moment.”\\n         He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\\n          “Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery\\nstuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re\\ngonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\\n            “And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy,\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n          “There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or\\nFang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter\\ntwo parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the\\nplace, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”\\n         “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\\n          “All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry,\\nan’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if\\nany of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\\nan’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\\nan’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\\n         The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in\\n\\x0cthe earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\\n         They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\\nthe fallen leaves.\\n        Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n        “Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\\n         “Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re\\npowerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\\n          They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\\nblood here and there along the winding path.\\n          “You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve\\ngone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT\\nTREE!”\\n         Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\\na towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\\nready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\\nleaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\\nsquinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\n        “I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”\\n        “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\\n          “That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\\ngrimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”\\n         They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\\nin a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n        “Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”\\n          And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut\\nbody with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.\\n        “Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”\\n        He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\\n          “Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\\nvoice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\\n            “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\n“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\\nGranger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s\\na centaur.\\n        “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.\\n\\x0c           “Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn\\nmuch, up at the school?”\\n        “Erm —”\\n        “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\\n          “A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\\nand stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”\\n         “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter\\nyeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\\n         Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\\nsighed again.\\n         “Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for\\nages past, so it is now.”\\n            “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’\\nunusual?”\\n           “Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\nimpatiently. “Unusually bright.”\\n            “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said\\nHagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”\\n          Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\\nhides many secrets.”\\n        A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\\nthan Ronan.\\n        “Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\\n        “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\\n        “Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in\\nhere lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\\n         Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\\nbright tonight,” he said simply.\\n           “We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\\nanythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”\\n         Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n           “Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\\n        “Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\\n           “Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re\\ngood enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind,\\ncentaurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”\\n\\x0c         “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.\\n         “Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s\\nbin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”\\n             They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\\nHe was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\\npassed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.\\n         “Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”\\n          “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back\\nfor yeh!”\\n            They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\\nlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\n         “You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\\n         “I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault\\nhe’s here in the first place.”\\n          The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s\\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\\ngoing on? Where were the others?\\n            At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\\nsneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\\nsent up the sparks.\\n           “We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were\\nmakin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’\\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\\nwhisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta\\nget this done.”\\n          So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\\nthought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\\nof a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\\nHarry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\\noak.\\n         “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\n         Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\n            It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles\\n\\x0cwhere it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\\n          Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…Then, out\\nof the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\\nstalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\\nreached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and\\nbegan to drink its blood.\\n         “AAAAAAAAAARGH!”\\n          Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded\\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling\\ndown its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t\\nmove for fear.\\n         Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\\nhis scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\\nfigure.\\n         The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\\nor two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\\nover him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\\nand a palomino body.\\n         “Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n         “Yes — thank you — what was that?”\\n           The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\\nout, livid, on Harry’s forehead.\\n          “You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\\nThe forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\\nquicker this way.\\n          “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n         There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\\nand sweaty.\\n         “Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\\nyour back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n          “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n         “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,\\nwe are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\n\\x0cto come in the movements of the planets?”\\n          Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was\\nacting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\n        Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n          “For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\\nstray humans in our forest!”\\n         Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\\ngrab his shoulders to stay on.\\n          “Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\\nset myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\\nalongside me if I must.”\\n         And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\n        Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n         “Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\\nfrom, anyway?”\\n         Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\\nof low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their\\nway through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t\\nwant to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\\npatch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n        “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\\n        “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn\\nand tail hair in Potions.”\\n         “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\\n“Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\\ndeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\\nthe blood touches your lips.”\\n         Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in\\nthe moonlight.\\n         “But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to\\nbe cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n         “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\\nto drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength\\nand power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\x0cknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n           “The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t\\nunderstand who —”\\n        “Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\\nwho has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n        It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.\\nOver the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\\nhim on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\\nDunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n        “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n        “Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n        Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\\nbehind her.\\n            “I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\\nunicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”\\n         “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\\nexamine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n        Harry slid off his back.\\n          “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n         He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\\nshivering behind him.\\n\\n    Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\\nHe shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\\nhim and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n         Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\\nwas still shaking.\\n         “Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the\\nforest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n         “Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\\nVoldemort could hear them.\\n        Harry wasn’t listening.\\n        “Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious…\\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\\nhappen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze\\nshould have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”\\n        “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.\\n\\x0c         “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went\\non feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I\\nsuppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\n        Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n         “Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was\\never afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.\\nAnyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\\nand Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\n         The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed\\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\n        When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded\\nneatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n    Just in case.\\n\\x0cHP 1 - Harry Potter and the\\n    Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\x0c                       \""

hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like them theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yeshard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask meits just a pity they let the old punishments die outhang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever neededright off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid im not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent directions theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs long teeth all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets go the forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away i knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself im armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this is ronan you two hes a centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly a bit well thats something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victims he said so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair fewkeep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaursthey know thingsjus don let on much dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got nevilleits our fault hes here in the first place the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closer it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredthen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet yes thank you what was that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs in anger for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shaking snape wants the stone for voldemortand voldemorts waiting in the forestand all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done sobane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happenthey must show that voldemorts coming backbane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill mei suppose thats written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in case hp harry potter and the sorcerers stone'"
